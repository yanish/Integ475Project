This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(igraph)
library(dplyr)
library(networkD3)
library(network)
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/Yanish/Documents/Fall_2015/Integ_475/mini_project_2/Integ475Project")

network <- read.graph("networks/net.graphml", format = "graphml" )
data_wetlands <- read.csv("data/dat.csv")

data <- select(data_wetlands, AF, SO, DT, PU, PI, PY, WC, SC, CL, SP, numAuthors)

glimpse(data)
glimpse(data_wetlands)
View(data_wetlands)

plot (network)

```
##Some text here just to make it seem like there will be text
```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
