AB Unregulated river floodplains are dynamic environments, and invertebrates living in these wetlands must be able to respond to fluctuating water levels. As water levels decrease in the floodplain, aquatic and semi-aquatic invertebrates may either move with the receding water or remain and become exposed to drying on non-inundated floodplain soil. Invertebrates inhabiting floodplains may use several strategies to cope with exposed (non-inundated) conditions; they may survive exposure by forming desiccation-resistant stages, emerging as adults (insects only), or living in a non-dormant state in exposed soil. To investigate invertebrate responses to a receding water line, benthic core samples were collected in exposed and inundated floodplain soil at successively lower water levels after a flood in the Sipsey River floodplain, west central Alabama. Insect emergence was also compared on inundated and exposed floodplain. Some invertebrate groups moved with the receding water line (aquatic chironomids, ostracods, cladocerans, copepods, Acari, and stratiomyids), while others did not (semi-aquatic/terrestrial chironomids, collembolans, oligochaetes, nematodes, diplurans, proturans, tenebrionids, and sciarids). Chironomids were the dominant emerging insect (73%), and adults emerged from both inundated (33 individuals m(-2) d(-1)) and exposed floodplain soil (15 individuals m(-1) d(-1)). These results document the importance of at least two survival strategies for aquatic invertebrates: moving with decreasing water levels and emerging from exposed floodplain soil (insects only). The semi-aquatic taxa not responding to receding water can survive in both exposed and inundated soil, at least for the short period observed in this study. Thus, many floodplain invertebrates in small-to-medium sized rivers are able to cope with a dynamic and unpredictable inundation pattern, which likely enhances wetland productivity.

AB Forms, amounts, and accumulation of soil phosphorus (P) were measured in natural and recently restored marshes surrounding Upper Klamath Lake located in south-central Oregon, USA to determine rates of P accumulation in natural marshes and to assess changes in P pools caused by long-term drainage in recently restored marshes. Soil cores were collected from three natural marshes and radiometrically dated to determine recent (Cs-137-based) and long-term (Pb-210-based) rates of peat accretion and P accumulation. A second set of soil cores collected from the three natural marshes and from three recently restored marshes was analyzed using a modification of the Hedley procedure to determine the forms and amounts of soil P. Total P in the recently restored marshes (222 to 311 mu g cm(-3)) was 2-3 times greater than in the natural marshes (103 to 117 mu g cm(-3)), primarily due to greater bulk density caused by soil subsidence, a consequence of long-term marsh drainage. Occluded Fe- and Al-bound P-i, calcium-bound P-i and residual P were 4 times, 22 times, and 5 times greater, respectively, in the recently restored marshes. More than 67% of the P pool in both the natural and recently restored marshes was present in recalcitrant forms (humic-acid P-o and residual P) that provide long-term P storage in peat. Phosphorus accumulation in the natural marshes averaged 0.45 g m(-2) yr(-1) (Cs-137) and 0.40 g m(-2) yr(-1) (Pb-210), providing a benchmark for optimizing P sequestration in the recently restored marshes. Effective P sequestration in the recently restored marshes, however, will depend on re-establishing equilibrium between the P-enriched soils and the P concentration of floodwaters and a hydrologic regime similar to the natural marshes.

ID HABITAT CONFIGURATION; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS; MEADOWS; AGE
AB The Floristic Quality Index (FQI) is a tool used to assess the conservation value of natural areas and monitor restoration success. Each native plant species is assigned a coefficient of conservatism, a subjective rating that describes its affinity for remnant natural areas. To calculate FQI, mean coefficient of conservatism (mean C) at a site is multiplied by the square root of native species richness. However, use of FQI is sometimes problematic, mainly because it incorporates species richness, which often varies with factors other than site conservation value. We surveyed 231 wetlands in a contiguous landscape that included the Beaucoup Creek floodplain in southern Illinois, USA and investigated the influence of landscape and site characteristics on species richness, mean C, FQI, and the proportion of site floras made up by wetland species and exotic species. Species richness and FQI increased significantly with site area or perimeter, indicating a bias toward higher assessments of quality in larger areas. Species richness and FQI in emergent wetlands increased with sampling date, suggesting that these sites should only be surveyed late in the growing season. Mean C and the proportion of site flora made up by wetland species decreased with increasing inter-wetland distance, indicating that isolation affects species composition. Both decreasing area and increasing inter-wetland distance were associated with lower FQI scores. Mean C, although not completely area-independent, was less strongly correlated with sampling date or area and may provide a more robust indicator of relative site conservation value than FQI when using the metrics to evaluate conservation value of jurisdictionally delineated plant communities.

TI Biologic zero: A soil temperature concept
SO WETLANDS

DT Article
DE wetlands; hydric soils; soil microbiology; growing season
AB Temperature effects on soil microbiological activity were well-documented in the first half of the 20(th) century, and many workers recognized that most (mesophyllic) soil microbes became relatively inactive at temperatures below 5 degrees to 10 degrees C. The term biologic zero first was published in the soil science literature in the first edition of Soil Taxonomy, where it was described as the temperature (5 degrees C) below which biological activity is sufficiently low that reducing conditions do not readily develop in saturated soils. While acknowledged as a generalization and simplification, this microbiologically based concept has continued to be affirmed by numerous workers in soil and wetland science. In the last two decades, the term has worked its way into numerous regulatory documents, usually associated with the concept or definition of growing season. Most recently, a new definition of biologic zero has been introduced by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS), which no longer is related primarily to soil microorganisms but, rather, is tied to higher plants. The new definition binds biologic zero to measurements taken at a specified depth (50 cm) and appears to be driven by an interest to modify and define better the concept of growing season for cooler climates. This change represents a fundamental departure from the long-held concept of biologic zero and may have significant ramifications on wetland regulatory issues.

AB In the Okavango Delta in Botswana, dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport is controlled by the slow movement of an annual flood 'pulse' across permanently and seasonally flooded wetlands, known respectively as the Permanent Swamp and Seasonal Swamp. We studied temporal and spatial variations in fluorescence index (FI) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) of DOM to identify DOM sources and fate during the flood. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 2 to 25 mg C L-1 in channels of the Delta, with seasonal floodplains having consistently higher concentrations. Chemical indices, such as DOC concentrations, conductivity, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence, total dissolved nitrogen, and chlorophyll a, were analyzed for channel and floodplain sites in the Seasonal Swamp. DOC concentrations increased during the rising limb of the flood in the Seasonal Swamp. SUVA of whole water samples and fluorescence index (FI) of fulvic acids isolated from channel and floodplain sites changed in a manner indicating the release of DOM by leaching of plant litter during the flood. After the flood receded, DOC concentrations and fulvic acid content decreased, and microbially-derived sources of organic matter dominated. Along two river reaches, measuring over 400 km each, variations in DOC concentrations were primarily due to geomorphology, with the effects of the annual flood overprinted atop the spatial controls. Increasing downstream DOC concentrations were found to be a product of inundation of DOC-rich seasonal floodplains and evaporation-enriched waters downstream. Increasing SUVA, dissolved nitrogen, and fulvic acid content, and decreasing FI downstream suggested microbial processing of terrestrial DOM and possible release of nutrients incorporated in the DOM.

AB Colonization by common reed (Phragmites australis) is often assumed to be driven mainly by vegetative growth of rhizomes. Seedlings are rarely observed in the field despite the annual flowering, the large seed production, and germination potential. We considered that this was mainly a consequence of the rare occurrence of the regeneration window of reed but, provided the suitable conditions were created, reed could efficiently colonize empty space by seedling establishment. We analyzed the relative importance of sexual and asexual propagation in a reed-dominated marsh in Southern France using past aerial photographs to reconstruct the reedbed dynamics over the last 25 years and a full-scale experiment simulating a rarely occurring low water level in spring. We observed phases of slow colonization corresponding to vegetative growth and periods of rapid closure of mudflats by reed. Reedbed dynamics were a combination of slow vegetative growth and a few phases of seedling establishment. The preservation of stable water levels favored colonization by vegetative growth. The experimental spring drawdown led to a 25% increase in reed area with up to 40 m progressions. Such rare events with low water levels in spring favor sexual colonization. Sexual reproduction plays an important role in the pioneer stage of reedbeds, allowing both fast progression and establishment of genetically diverse stands.

AB Vegetation pattern and dynamics were characterized across a mid-Texas, USA coastal marsh ecotone subjected to snow goose herbivory, drought, and salt-water pulses. For eight years following snow goose feeding, species cover was evaluated in heavy and light goose-use patches at increasing distances from tidal influence. Just prior to and for two years after the feeding event, drought, and several salt-water pulses associated with tropical storms typified the hydrologic dynamics of the marsh. Herbivory history was more important than distance from tidal influence, salinity, or flooding in explaining spatial and temporal vegetation pattern for three years. Precipitation variation influenced vegetation dynamics in areas heavily used by geese. Recovery to pre-herbivory composition and abundance required six years without further snow goose feeding. Extremes of annual precipitation, salinities, and water levels impacted cover of Spartina patens dominated patches little unless feeding snow geese uprooted vegetation. Schoenoplectus americanus was more impacted by extremes of environmental dynamics than S. patens but even more impacted by synergistic effects of uprooting and environmental extremes. During this period, the ecotone could be characterized as patchy, with a gulfward waxing and waning of S. americanus.

AB Prescribed burning is often used in wetlands to remove plant litter, decrease woody or invasive species, and increase use by wetland birds. However, little is known about the within-season, short-term response of wetland birds to prescribed burning, especially during spring migration. We surveyed use of 19 burned and 19 unburned (reference) wetlands by migratory birds in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska, USA during three spring migrations, 2002-2004. We calculated the change in avian abundance and species richness, as well as generating the Sorenson's similarity index for burned and reference wetlands in the weeks immediately before and after burning. We compared Sorenson's index values and percent change in abundance and species richness between burned and reference wetlands using an analysis of covariance with week and wetland area as covariates to account for migration chronology and differences in the area of experimental units. Following removal of effects due to wetland area and week, burning had no effect on the percent change in avian abundance and species richness. Sorenson's index also did not differ between burned and reference wetlands. Prescribed burning did not improve use of wetlands by migratory birds in the short term. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of prescribed burning on migratory avian abundance, species richness, and community composition is imperative for management decisions.

AB The fate of vascular plant detritus and the microbial communities and processes involved during the decomposition of litter are important aspects in elucidating energy flow and nutrient cycling in wetlands. Therefore, we collected and identified conspicuous fungal sporocarps in situ and isolated microfungi from living and dead Typha latifolia (cattail) leaf tissues. Cattail is a dominant plant species in southern boreal and temperate marshes and abundant in the Low Boreal Mixedwood ecoregion in central Alberta, Canada. Following two successive field collections in early and late summer 2001, 45 different fungal taxa were identified. There were 26 ascomycetes, five basidiomycetes, and 14 anamorphic taxa, most of them with putative ascomycetous affinities. Twenty-four taxa represented new records for T. latifolia, 12 were new to Canada, and seven were new to North America. Also, five taxa were new reports outside of the country of the type locality. To elucidate their roles in the decomposition of T. latifolia leaves, we examined 33 taxa for their ability to use cellulose, gelatin, starch, tannic acid, and lignin as carbon sources (based on calorimetric tests), as well as to cause mass losses of sterile T. latifolia leaves. The number of fungi using cellulose and gelatin as carbon sources was significantly greater than those using starch, tannic acid, or lignin. Mass losses of T. latifolia leaf tissues by ascomycetes and basidiomycetes ranged from 1.3 to 54.6% and -0.4 to 52.1%, respectively. There was a positive relationship between mass loss of T. latifolia leaves and cellulose degradation but not between mass loss and any of the other carbon sources. Our data showed that a taxonomically diverse suite of fungi effectively degrades this plant material; however, additional studies examining the decomposer communities of other dominant wetland plants are necessary to gain a better understanding of nutrient and energy dynamics in wetlands at the ecosystem level.

AB Insufficient water supply and poor water quality are major problems in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon and northern California, USA. Various land-management practices and competing demands for water in much of the basin have led to degraded environmental conditions and poor water quality (excessive nutrients, warm temperatures, high pH, low dissolved oxygen). Of particular interest are the water-quality impacts of wetland management at Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge. Wetlands in the refuge are intensely managed through a system of canals, drains, and water-control structures, but the impacts of this management are not known. Data for inflows, outflows, field water-quality parameters, and nutrient concentrations were collected and analyzed in 1999 and 2000. Water budgets and nutrient loads were developed for the refuge. Water-quality impacts from wetland management include higher conductivity and water temperatures but lower turbidity. Outflow nutrient concentrations of N and P are generally increased relative to inflow concentrations, but nutrient loads are reduced. From 55 to 77% of the mass of N and 19 to 51% of the mass of P entering the refuge wetlands is retained. Seasonal wetlands retain less P than permanent wetlands or farmed units, possibly because of the annual drying cycle, the later drainage dates, and predominance of annual vegetation. For all refuge wetlands, dissolved inorganic N is retained more efficiently than particulate N, and particulate P is retained more efficiently than soluble reactive P. The ultimate effect of refuge wetland management is to decrease net N and P loads but increase the ratio of bioavailable P to bioavailable N in the refuge outflow.

AB I reviewed information from 73 sources on soil animals in flooded grassland, focusing on soil macrofauna: snails and slugs (Gastropoda), earthworms (Lumbricidae), potworms (Enchytraeidae), woodlice (Isopoda), millipedes (Chilopoda, Diplopoda), Diptera, and other insect larvae. While the database on earthworms was rather comprehensive, studies on all other soil fauna groups, especially regarding their role in wetlands were few and showed major research needs. The survival strategies of the groups were compared systematically. Annelids and insect larvae had the best physiological adaptations, other groups only reacted with evasion by active or passive movement and by recolonization and reproduction from resistant stages. There were no typical "wetland species" in soil macrofauna, only tolerant hygrophilous species. Flooding of grassland immediately reduced diversity, abundance, and biomass of all groups of soil macrofauna. Their community structure was altered, and well-adapted species, often wide-spread opportunists, became more abundant while others disappeared. The effects increased with the duration of flooding and rising temperature but were usually compensated for during the next soil-dry period. A meta-analysis classified sites according to duration, frequency, and seasonality of inundation. In general, species numbers and abundances of earthworms, woodlice, and millipedes tended to be lower in frequently and/or extensively flooded sites. Only gastropods are favored by moderate winter flooding. In bogs, even when they are waterlogged the entire year, species numbers are distinctly higher than the most frequently flooded sites. The impact of episodic summer flooding events is transitional and less pronounced than that of regular winter flooding. Earthworms re-establish soil structure after flooding, and they are, next to dipteran larvae, an important prey for wetland birds. Slow, moderate flooding in winter, waterlogging in spring, and a landscape mosaic with non-flooded refuge sites is recommended for water management policies favorable for both soil fauna and wetland birds.

AB Vegetation in intermittently flooded wetlands is strongly affected by the influence of hydrologic condition on species establishment and survival. The vegetation of four herbaceous depression meadow Carolina bay wetlands on the Upper Coastal Plain in the southeastern USA was sampled while systems were flooded in 1999 and again in 2002, near the end of a multi-year drought during which all bays were dry. The seed banks of these bays were sampled in the spring of 2000 and their relationship to the extant vegetation at both ends of the hydrologic spectrum examined. All bays lost previously abundant perennial aquatic species during the drought, and grasses, especially a rhizomatous perennial, Panicum hemitomon, expanded. While approximately half the species in the vegetation were also found in the seed bank, more than 60% of species in the seed bank were never detected in the vegetation. Also, widespread species in the vegetation, especially grasses and aquatic herbs, were rare or absent in the seed bank. The results of the study were consistent with a cyclic model of herbaceous Carolina bay vegetation dynamics in which aquatic and grass species dominate in turn as climate oscillates between wet and dry periods. Further, it appears that, in herbaceous Carolina bays, a handful of dominant aquatic and grass species in the vegetation may influence composition more strongly than widespread recruitment from the seed bank as hydrologic condition fluctuates.

AB In a system with mercury contamination, there are trade-offs between beneficial functions of a wetland and environmental risk of methyl mercury (MeHg) production. This project used five wetland mesocosms with three different experimental designs to assess the potential for nutrient, sediment, and total mercury (THg) removal and MeHg production associated with a proposed a large-scale wetland system. The latter was suggested for the mouth of Steamboat Creek (Nevada, USA) at the confluence with the Truckee River. Steamboat Creek has been documented to have high mercury concentrations and is a major source of nutrients to the river. Mesocosms that had creek sediments as the base and creek water as inflows resulted in decreasing THg concentration by 72-82%. Average percent nitrogen and phosphorus and suspended solids removal were 43%, 30%, and 70%, respectively. Net MeHg production was observed during spring, summer, and fall months; however, in the winter, these mesocosms acted as a sink. One wetland mesocosm with sediments low in mercury and creek water showed similar trends. Mesocosms with creek sediments and water low in mercury were a source of MeHg year round, with outflow concentrations 10 to 200 times that in the inflow. Based on the developed data, the environmental risk of the proposed large-scale wetland would be an increase of methyl mercury concentration in creek water that reaches the Truckee River by as much as 20 to 75%. However, the wetland would also be a significant sink for nutrients, suspended solids, and total mercury, decreasing the amount of mercury available for methylation downstream.

AB Cheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, USA has been designated by the Ramsar convention as a Wetland of International Importance. However, since that 1988 designation, cattail (Typha spp.) has become the dominant plant within the basin, and migratory bird use has decreased. We examined the effects of different cattail-management treatments (burned, disked, and grazed by 5 and 20 head of cattle) on macroinvertebrates used as food resources by migratory birds. We found few differences in diversity, biomass, or density of macroinvertebrates among treatments. When differences existed, diversity, biomass, and density were greater within the control or more heavily vegetated treatments (e.g., burned) than within less vegetated treatments (e.g., disked). Macroinvertebrate densities, particularly Chironomidae, ranged from 154 to 681/m(2); however, they were up to seven times lower than historic densities and well below the 5000/m(2) that has been suggested for supporting large numbers (0.5 million) of migratory waterbirds. Thus, Cheyenne Bottoms' capacity to support migratory waterbirds may currently be reduced due to low macroinvertebrate densities in areas where cattail has invaded, as well as in areas where cattail has been managed. Research and management should be targeted at restoring the hydrology and dependent biotic communities that support migratory birds.

AB Wetlands are abundant throughout the prairie pothole region (PPR), an area comprising over 700,000 km(2) in central North America. Prairie wetland communities are strongly influenced by regional physiography and climate, resulting in extreme spatial and temporal variability relative to other aquatic ecosystems. Given the strong influence of abiotic factors, PPR wetland communities have been viewed traditionally in the context of their responses to chemical and physical features of landscape and climate. Although useful, this physical-chemical paradigm may fail to account for ecosystem variability due to biotic influences, particularly those associated with presence of fish. Spatial and temporal variability in fish populations, in turn, may reflect anthropogenic activities, landscape characteristics, and climate-mediated effects on water levels, surface connectivity, and hydroperiods. We reviewed studies assessing influences of fish on prairie wetlands and examined precipitation patterns and biological data from PPR wetlands in east-central North Dakota and western Minnesota, USA. Our review and analysis indicated that native fish influence many characteristics of permanently flooded prairie wetlands, including water clarity and abundance of phytoplankton, submerged macrophytes, and aquatic invertebrates. We suggest that ecologists and managers will benefit from conceptual paradigms that better meld biotic interactions associated with fish, and perhaps other organisms, with chemical and physical influences on prairie wetland communities.

ID REMOTELY SENSED DATA; ACCURACY
AB This study analyzed change of a coastal wetland using remote sensing, image processing, and GIS techniques. Aerial photographs from 1928, 1945, 1975, and 1994 were acquired for San Dieguito Lagoon, in San Diego County, California, USA. The photographs were scanned and the landscape classified as wetland or non-wetland. A GIS model quantified and indicated trends in wetland change. Results show that, in 1928, 50% (366 ha) of the study area was comprised of wetlands. By 1994, the total wetland area decreased to 15% (109 ha) of the study site area. The annualized loss reveals a continual decrease in the rate of loss over all three time periods, which corresponds to the national decline in the rate of wetland loss. The greatest loss rate occurred from 1928 to 1945 (3% per year), and the lowest rate of loss occurred from 1975 to 1994 (0.3% per year).

AB Information on species- and stage-specific patterns of contaminant accumulation is generally lacking for amphibians, yet Such information Could provide valuable knowledge on how amphibians interact with contaminants. We assessed concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Ni. Pb, Se, Sr, and Zn in whole bodies of larval, recently metamorphosed, and adult life stages in Bufo terrestris and Rana sphenocephala front a site that Currently receives coal combustion waste (CCW) discharge, a site where CCW was formerly discharged that has undergone natural attenuation for 30 years, and a nearby reference site. For the majority of elements (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb. Zn). concentrations were highest in larvae, but Se and Sr concentrations remained elevated in later life stages, likely because these elements are S and Ca analogs, respectively, and are thus retained throughout structural changes during metamorphosis. Element concentrations were generally higher in B. terrestris than in R. sphenocephala. Concentrations of As, Se, and Sr were up to 11-35 times higher in metamorphs emigrating from CCW-polluted wetlands compared to unpolluted wetlands, suggesting metamorphosed amphibians can transport trace elements from aquatic disposal basins to nearby uncontaminated terrestrial habitats. In addition. anurans utilizing naturally revegetated sites LIP to 30 years after CCW disposal ceases are exposed to trace elements. although to a lesser degree than sites where CCW is currently discharged.

AB This study investigated the role of hydrology, soils, and trampling in determining the distribution of vegetation in an isolated wetland from 1996 to 1999. Grassy Pond, in Litchfield, New Hampshire, is a seasonally flooded basin marsh situated in sandy soils. It is a depressional wetland consisting of three connected basins; it has no surface-water inlets or outlets. This acidic, low-nutrient wetland contains several rare species and represents an uncommon ecosystem type in New England. A network of wells and piezometers monitored from 1996 to 1999 established that the wetland receives an average of 95.4% of its growing season inputs from precipitation and the rest from shallow ground water flowing through the wetland; as a result, it experiences large fluctuations in water levels. Vegetation in the wetland fell into five major elevation zones. Variation in plant diversity within each zone, and differences between adjacent zones, result in part from differences in depth of organic layer, trampling by hikers, all-terrain vehicles, and native wildlife, and the extent of water-level fluctuations. Several of the low basin species are more likely to be found in trampled areas. Shrub invasion of the open basin areas is prevented by trampling in some areas and by high water levels in others. Variability in hydrology resulted in temporal, as well as spatial, variability in the plant community, as dry years yielded significantly greater diversity, including a large increase in tree seedlings. Both hydrologic variability and trampling are external factors that explain a significant portion of the variation in vegetation on a large scale and connect this geographically isolated wetland to the surrounding landscape. On a smaller scale, however, autogenic forces related to soil formation and plant species interactions may be more important in explaining the plant diversity in the wetland.

AB Field collections during November of green-winged teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and coot (Fulica atra) feces in Denmark, England, and France were used to examine the potential of waterbirds to disperse aquatic plant, algae, and invertebrate species across Europe. A total of 216 fecal samples were collected, of which 28% contained intact seeds of common wetland plants (Scirpus spp., Eleocharis spp., Chenopodium spp.), 7% contained algae oogonia (Chara spp.), and 14% contained invertebrate diapause eggs that included ephippia (Daphnia spp.) and non-ephippial eggs. Many propagules, such as Chenopodium seeds, Charophyte oogonia, and invertebrate diapause eggs, were of small size, indicating that either consumption rates or the probability to pass the gut intact is higher for smaller propagule sizes. We found averages of from 0.1 to 1.9 intact seeds and 0.1 to 0.9 intact oogonia and diapause eggs per duck or coot dropping. Our data indicate that propagules of aquatic plants, algae, and invertebrates can be deposited in feces by these waterbird species. We did not measure the viability of propagules and, therefore, have not shown that these propagules escaped digestion to the extent that viability was not altered. Although any given bird may carry few intact propagules, the thousands of waterbirds moving among wetlands collectively are potentially effective at dispersing many species of aquatic organisms.

AB Benthic Chironomidae were studied in two shallow, brackish, eutrophic wetlands in Alicante province in eastern Spain (Levante lake in El Hondo Natural Park and Murtulas ponds in Santa Pola Natural Park). Core samples were taken monthly from eight points in each site from March to August 1999. Levante was more eutrophic, less saline, and held more and larger chironomid larvae than Murtulas. Larvae of six taxa were identified at Levante and five at Murtulas. Chironomus aprilinus and C. salinarius morphotypes dominated at Levante, whereas Tanytarsus spp. and C. salinarius dominated at Murtulas. In generalized linear models, there were significant effects of site, month, and site X month interactions on larval size at both family and taxon levels. On average, C. salinarius larvae were larger at MUR, probably due to a lower proportion of smaller instars and lower growth rates. Although the overall trend was for a reduction in mean larval size over time in both wetlands, mean size peaked in March at Levante and in May at Murtulas.

AB A central tenet of wetland mitigation is that replacement wetlands can sequester nutrients and perform other functions at the same level as natural wetlands. This study evaluated phosphorus (P) sorption capacity and P exchange in flooded soil microcosms obtained from eight early successional (ES) mitigated and eight late successional (LS) bottomland forest wetlands in western Kentucky, USA. The LS soils had three times greater capacity to remove and retain soluble inorganic P than ES soils, which was mostly due to higher amounts of amorphous aluminum (A1) oxides (oxalate extractable), organically-bound A1 (CuCl2 extractable), and organic carbon in LS soils. Phosphorus exchange rates between the soil and water column were not significantly different in LS and ES microcosms, but rates in both systems were strongly related to the molar ratio of Mehlich III extractable P to A1 + Fe in the soil (r(2)=0.64). Relationships between P sorption/exchange and organic C, Mehlich III- and oxalate-extractable forms of P, Al, and Fe determined in this study could be useful for (i) identifying suitable mitigation sites that would be P sinks rather than P sources to the water column and (ii) determining replacement ratios that would fairly compensate for P retention capacity losses caused by destruction/alteration of Kentucky bottomland hardwood forest wetlands.

AB Aquatic vascular plants, or macrophytes, are an important habitat component for many wetland organisms, and larvae of chironomid midges are ubiquitous components of wetland fauna. Many chironomids are primary consumers of algae and detritus and form an essential energetic link between allochthonous and autochthonous primary production and higher trophic levels, while others are predators and feed on smaller invertebrates. Live macrophytes serve mostly as habitat, whereas plant detritus serves as both habitat and as a food source. Assemblages of macrophytes and chironomid larvae were surveyed in ten Maine wetlands, five with low pH (< 5.0) and five with high pH (> 5.5), and explained in terms of physical and chemical habitat variables. Macrophyte richness was significantly greater, and richness of chironomid larvae was lower, in low pH wetlands. There was no difference in chironomid abundance related to pH. However, community structure was related to pH, suggesting that competitive dominance of a few taxa was responsible for lower richness in low pH wetlands, whereas competition was weaker in high pH wetlands, making coexistence of more chironomid taxa possible. An examination of individual chironomid taxa by stepwise multiple regression showed that distribution of most taxa was controlled by water chemistry variables and macrophyte habit (i.e., floating, submergent).

AB Although considerable attention has been focused on competition among wetland plants, surprisingly few studies have considered the role of facilitation in structuring freshwater wetland plant assemblages. Positive interaction among plants has been investigated thoroughly in saline marshes, which display a definite, predictable pattern of species zonation, with facilitation playing an important role during colonization of bare or disturbed patches of marsh. The few studies that have investigated facilitation in freshwater marshes have implicated the processes of sediment oxygenation and sediment stabilization. Whereas both processes are known to be influenced by many freshwater hydrophyte species, they have not been considered widely as mechanisms of interspecific facilitation. In the tussock-forming rush Juncus effusus L., late-Spring collapse of culms away from the tussock center results in a morphology that increases light availability atop tussocks and appears to establish a unique spatio-temporal component to the effect of Juncus on neighbors. In previous work, shading around the tussock periphery, influenced largely by this collapse of culms, was shown to suppress production and species richness of neighbors; however, various plant species have been observed to grow directly upon the Juncus tussocks in the void left by collapsed culms. To quantify this latter phenomenon, vascular plant abundance was evaluated on tussocks of Juncus effusus in four Mississippi (USA) beaver wetlands to determine the likelihood and nature of positive interactions between Juncus and neighbors. Tussocks in three of these wetlands were examined for tussock microtopography and diameter, relative water depth atop the tussock, and colonization by other plant species. Species richness of colonizing plants correlated positively with tussock diameter in two of these wetlands, and no colonizers were present in the third. Tussock microtopography and elevation differed significantly among wetlands, but species richness was unrelated to relative water depth atop the tussocks. In the fourth beaver marsh, two sets of surveys were conducted to determine whether the species assemblages upon Juncus tussocks differed from those across the entire wetland. Plant assemblages on Juncus tussocks, and on elevated substrata in general, were significantly different from assemblages not associated with elevated surfaces. Thirteen species were associated exclusively with elevated rooting substrata, ten of which were exclusive to Juncus effusus tussocks. The present results suggest that small-scale spatial and temporal shifts occur in the effects of Juncus on neighboring plants. Effects shift from primarily competitive shading interactions resulting from a dense shoot canopy to facilitative interactions atop tussock mounds after mature culms collapse. Facilitation likely is mediated through characteristics of the tussock mound, such as provision of a stable rooting substratum or oxygenation of sediments by the Juncus effusus root system.

AB Missouri Coteau prairie glacial wetlands are subject to numerous anthropogenic disturbances, such as cultivation, construction, and chemical inputs from upland land-use practices. High wetland density and temporal variability among these ecosystems necessitate synoptic tools for watershed-scale wetlands assessment and comprehensive monitoring. We developed a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) classification model for Missouri Coteau prairie glacial wetlands in North Dakota, USA and derived two indices that provide data salient to landscape-scale wetland assessment and monitoring. One, the Basin Buffer Index (BBI), delineates areas of natural vegetation that buffer waters from anthropogenic disturbance. The second, the Hydric Vegetation Index (HVI), delineates areas of hydric vegetation communities essential to prairie glacial wetland function. The model was developed by spectrally characterizing structural attributes common to glacial basins, such as hydroperiod, canopy architecture, and plant life-form and evaluating the potential for spectral detection of the natural vegetation buffers that surround these wetlands. Spectral separation among community zones in the green, red, and mid-infrared regions were evident in hyperspectral data and were convolved to fit multi-spectral satellite sensors. Model application using Landsat ETM+ and SPOT 5 satellite data over the central North Dakota study area produced classifications for buffer delineation and hydric community detection with 89 and 85% accuracy, respectively. By integrating remote sensing technology with those structural factors fundamental to wetland quality (i.e., land-use and natural vegetation buffers surrounding water bodies), we illustrate a method for evaluating wetland condition at a landscape scale.

AB We evaluated the effect of four hydraulic retention times (HRT, 0.3, 0.8, 2.3, and 9.3 days) on pollutant removal in a surface-flow wetland system for polishing tertiary effluent from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The removal efficiency of pollutants at these HRTs was based on mass budgets of the water inputs and outputs in parallel ditches, which together with a presettling basin, made up the wetland system. Fecal coliform and N-removal efficiencies in the ditches were enhanced by increasing the HRT, with only little removal of fecal coliforms during spring-summer at a HRT of 0.3 days. A HRT of 4 days turned out to be required to meet the desired bathing water standard for fecal coliforms (10(3) cfu 100 ml(-1)) and the future standard of ammonium (1 mg N l(-1)) all year. An annual N-removal efficiency of approximately 45% can be accomplished in the ditches at this HRT, corresponding to an annual N mass loading rate of 150 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Annual P removal was not improved by increasing the HRT even up to 9.3 days, largely because of the still high P mass loading rate (14 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) in combination with relatively low P input concentrations. Substantial P removal can probably only be achieved at HRTs longer than 15 days, which will not be feasible for the situation investigated because of the large land area that would be required to reach such long HRTs. The future P standard (1 mg P l(-1)) can therefore only be met by additional chemical P removal. In a densely populated country such as the Netherlands, adequate polishing of tertiary STP effluent in surface-flow wetlands with similar goals as for this wetland is restricted to small and medium-sized STPs. The simultaneous use of these treatment wetlands for other functions, such as nature conservation, recreation, and flood control, however, would permit the use of relatively larger land areas.

AB Although seed dispersal is assumed to be a major factor determining plant community development in restored wetlands, little research exists on density and species richness of seed available through dispersal in these systems. We measured composition and seed dispersal rates at a restored tidal freshwater marsh in Washington, DC, USA by collecting seed dispersing through water and wind. Seed dispersal by water was measured using two methods of seed collection: (1) stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat along an elevation gradient bracketing the tidal range and (2) a floating surface trawl net attached to a boat. To estimate wind dispersal rates, we collected seed from stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat positioned above marsh vegetation. We also collected a small number of samples of debris deposited along high tide lines (drift lines) and feces of Canada Goose to explore their seed content. We used the seedling emergence method to determine seed density in all samples, which involved placing the fiber mats or sample material on top of potting soil in a greenhouse misting room and enumerating emerging seedlings. Seedlings from a total of 125 plant species emerged during this study (including 82 in river trawls, 89 in stationary water traps, 21 in drift lines, 39 in wind traps, and 10 in goose feces). The most abundant taxa included Bidens frondosa, Boehmeria cylindrica, Cyperus spp., Eclipta prostrata, and Ludwigia palustris. Total seedling density was significantly greater for the stationary water traps (212 +/- 30.6 seeds/m(2)/month) than the equal-sized stationary wind traps (18 +/- 6.0 seeds/m(2)/month). Lower-bound estimates of total species richness based on the non-parametric Chao 2 asymptotic estimators were greater for seeds in water (106 +/- 1.4 for stationary water traps and 104 +/- 5.5 for trawl samples) than for wind (54 +/- 6.4). Our results indicate that water is the primary source of seeds dispersing to the site and that a species-rich pool of dispersing propagules is present, an interesting result given the urbanized nature of the surrounding landscape. However, species composition of dispersing seeds differed from vegetation of restored and natural tidal freshwater marshes, indicating that planting is necessary for certain species. At other restoration sites, information on densities of dispersing seeds can support decisions on which species to plant.

AB The coterminous U.S. has lost more than 50% of its wetlands since colonial times. Today, wetlands are highly valued for many functions including temporary storage of surface water, streamflow maintenance, nutrient transformation, sediment retention, shoreline stabilization, and provision of fish and wildlife habitat. Government agencies and other organizations are actively developing plans to help protect, conserve, and restore wetlands in watersheds. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Program (NWI) has produced wetland maps, digital geospatial data, and wetland trends data to aid these and other conservation efforts. Most recently, the NWI has developed procedures to expand the amount of information contained within its digital databases to characterize wetlands better. It has also developed techniques to use these data to predict wetland functions at the watershed level. Working with the states of Delaware and Maryland, the NWI applied these techniques to the Nanticoke River watershed to aid those states in developing a watershed-wide wetland conservation strategy. Wetland databases for pre-settlement and contemporary conditions were prepared. An assessment of wetland functions was conducted for both time periods and comparisons made. Before European settlement, the Nanticoke watershed had an estimated 93,000 ha of wetlands covering 45% of the watershed. By 1998, the wetland area had been reduced to 62% of its original extent. Sea-level rise and wetland conversion to farmland were the principal causes of wetland loss. From the functional standpoint, the watershed lost over 60% of its original capacity for streamflow maintenance and over 35% for four other functions (surface-water detention, nutrient transformation, sediment and particulate retention, and provision of other wildlife habitat). This study demonstrated the value of enhanced NWI data and its use for providing watershed-level information on wetland functions and for assessing the cumulative impacts to wetlands. It provides natural resource managers and planners with a toot that can be applied consistently to watersheds and large geographic areas to show the extent of wetland change and its projected effect on wetland functions.

AB Post-restoration wetland sites often do not resemble natural wetlands in diversity or richness of native species, in part due to the influence of stressors such as excess contaminant loads and invasive species. Road salt and the salt-tolerant invasive Typha angustifolia are potential wetland stressors for which little is known, although it is thought that high salt contaminant loads can lead to invasion of a plant community by T. angustifolia. To understand how an establishing freshwater wetland community responds to NaCl, with regard to both direct and indirect effects (indirect mediated by competition with T. angustifolia), an assemblage of native marsh species was grown from seed in greenhouse microcosms and subjected to treatments of NaCl (0, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg(.)L(-1) solutions) and T. angustifolia (with and without T. angustifolia seed additions) for 194 days. Direct effects of NaCl on final biomass of the native assemblage were observed in the 500 and 1000 mg(.)L(-1) NaCl treatments. Indirect effects of NaCl on final biomass were observed in the 1000 mg(.)L(-1) NaCl treatment. Diversity and species richness decreased slightly with increasing NaCl concentration. Evenness increased slightly with increasing NaCl concentration. Individual species responded differently to NaCl and T. angustifolia, suggesting that species composition plays an important role in determining the extent to which NaCl and T. angustifolia influence native community establishment. Results from this experiment suggest that road salt runoff should be considered a stressor during site selection and that restoration of sites exposed to high levels of NaCl may be less diverse or contain an assemblage of species different than that intended.

TI Flooding constraints on tree (Taxodium distichum) and herb growth
   responses to elevated CO2

AB Elevated CO2 generally stimulates C-3-type photosynthesis, but it is unclear how an increase in CO2, assimilation will interact with other factors that influence plant growth. In wetlands, the response of plants to elevated CO2, will interact with soil saturation, particularly in forested wetlands where soil saturation is a strong regulator of plant productivity. We performed a four-month experiment to determine whether elevated CO2 and flooding interact to influence the growth of a flood-tolerant tree (Taxodium distichum) and a flood-tolerant herbaceous emergent macrophyte (Orontium aquaticum). Seedlings were grown in glasshouses at two CO2 levels (350 and 700 mu L L-1) crossed with two water depths (5 cm above and >= 5 cm below the soil surface). We hypothesized that elevated CO2, would increase photosynthesis regardless of water depth and species; however, we also expected flooding to prevent elevated CO2, from increasing the growth of the tree species due to 0, limitation or other physiological stresses associated with reduced soil environments. We found that elevated CO2, increased whole-plant photosynthesis in both species regardless of the flooding treatment. For T. distichum, this higher photosynthetic rate resulted in greater biomass only in the non-flooded treatment. This result suggests that some factor related to flooding constrained the biomass response of the flooded woody plants to elevated CO2. In contrast, elevated CO2, increased O. aquaticum biomass regardless of the flooding regime, perhaps because it occurs in wetter landscape positions than T. distichum and is less sensitive to flooding. We conclude that flooding may limit plant growth responses to elevated CO2, particularly in woody plant species.

AB While intensified nutrient limitation of periphyton has been reported along wetland nutrient-depletion gradients, changes to the specific nutrient that limits periphyton growth are not documented. In this study, we used artificial nutrient-diffusing substrata to determine nutrient limitation status of periphyton along a nitrogen- and phosphorus-depletion gradient in a freshwater marsh during the growing season of 2003. We also characterized water-column nutrient content, N:P ratio of dissolved nutrients, and periphytic NZ fixation potential along the gradient. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations consistently decreased (60% - 95%) from inflow to outflow during all bioassays, while soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations decreased during the April (49%) and September (39%) bioassays but increased in the July bioassay (51%). Unequal N and P retention resulted in a general decrease in DIN:SRP mass ratio from 20.2 +/- 5.0 to 3.8 +/- 1.6 between inflow and outflow, respectively. Periphyton at the wetland inflow never responded to N additions alone, while periphyton at the outflow always responded to N enrichment. Periphyton at the inflow were either not limited by nutrients (September) or co-limited by N+P (April and July). At the outflow, periphyton were either N-limited (April and September) or strongly co-limited by N+P (July). A significant increase in N-2 fixation potential (p < 0.05) from inflow to outflow locations was noted for all measured events. Our results suggest that, in addition to the severity of nutrient limitation, some wetlands may display spatial heterogeneity in the specific nutrient that limits periphyton growth. Further, these shifts influence the structure and function of wetland periphyton assemblages.

AB Wetlands provide critical wildlife habitat in the central Platte River basin of Nebraska, USA, but little is known about their macroinvertebrate communities or how factors such as hydrology affect them. In 1997, we quantified macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and community structure and organic matter resources in four natural wetlands that represented a gradient from ephemeral to permanent flooding. All four wetlands had abundant macroinvertebrate communities when flooded, and we observed unique taxa at all sites. Mean annual macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass increased with hydroperiod length, but taxon richness and diversity were greatest in intermittent sites. Non-insect groups, mostly crustaceans, annelids, and mollusks, were important at all sites, and their taxonomic composition shifted across the hydrologic gradient. Insect communities were dominated by dipterans (mostly Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae) and Coleopterans (mostly Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae), and these also varied across the hydrologic gradient. Collector-gatherers, scrapers, and predators were the dominant functional groups in terms of biomass, and biomass was most evenly distributed among these groups in intermittent sites. Macroinvertebrate communities in these riparian wetlands vary across natural hydrologic gradients, and diversity peaks in intermittent sites. Patterns of abundance, biomass, and diversity, along with seasonal patterns, suggest that, at a landscape level, a diversity of wetland habitats with different hydrologic regimes will maximize abundance and diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities in this region.

AB Vernal pool wetlands are at risk of destruction across the northeast United States, due in part to their diminutive size and short hydroperiods. These characteristics make it difficult to locate vernal pool habitats in the landscape during much of the year, and no efficient method exists for predicting their occurrence. A logistic regression procedure was used to identify large-scale variables that influence the presence of a potential vernal pool, including surficial geology, land use and land cover, soil classification, topography, precipitation, and surficial hydrologic features. The model was validated with locations of field-verified vernal pools. The model demonstrated that the probability of potential vernal pool occurrence is positively related to slope, negatively related to till/bedrock surficial geology, and negatively related to the proportion of cropland, urban/commercial, and high density residential development in the landscape. The relationship between vernal pool occurrence and large-scale variables suggests that these habitats do not occur at random in the landscape, and thus, protection in situ should be considered.

AB During a broad study of invertebrate colonization in marginal fluvial wetlands of the Middle Parana River in Argentina, cyst formation was observed in two of the 26 species of aquatic oligochaetes identified from the study-Dero multibranchiata Steiren, 1892 (Tubificidae, Naidinae), and Trieminentia corderoi (Harman, 1969) (Opistocystidae). All specimens of the two species in which cyst formation was observed had been collected after drying conditions ranging from 14 to 28 days. A clitellum was not observed in any of the specimens collected. Lengths of specimens ranged from 0.88 mm to 2.84 mm in Dero multibranchiata and 2.25 mm to 2.40 mm in Trieminentia corderoi. The development of protective cysts by Dero multibranchiata and Trieminentia corderoi, and perhaps many other species of aquatic oligochaetes, appears to be an adaptive strategy enabling them to survive drought in temporary wetlands, recolonize freshwater habitats upon inundation, and disperse both laterally and downstream with rising water levels in wetlands and streams.

ID LICHENOMETRY
AB Saxicolous lichen trimlines are relatively level and distinct transition zones found on bedrock-lined shores. They occur as a result of disturbance to the rock lichen community, typically due to high water events. Trimlines can inform about previous high water conditions, and in conjunction with lichenometry, can be dated. In wetlands which fluctuate in water level, dated trimlines may be useful in reconstruction of the timing and magnitude of former high water. We assessed seven common northern saxicolous lichen species over a period of 270 days to determine the period of immersion required for mortality. Overall mortality rates increased after about 30 days of immersion. At 90 days, mean mortality was about 68%; at 180 days, mean mortality was about 91%; total mortality of the immersed lichens was observed at day 270. There were large interspecific differences in susceptibility to immersion. Phaeophyscia sciastra was the least susceptible to immersion and Xanthoparmelia somloensis was the most susceptible to immersion. A prolonged period of high water (months, rather than days) may be required to form a trimline in a northern delta. A northern saxicolous trimline might remain visually distinct for several decades in the absence of disturbance.

AB Inorganic mercury and methylmercury concentrations were measured both in guts and remaining carcasses of southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) larvae from 10 Carolina bay wetlands in South Carolina, USA. Significant variation among bays in methylmercury and inorganic mercury concentrations existed both in guts and carcasses. There was a moderate negative correlation between dissolved organic carbon concentration in bays and mean inorganic mercury concentrations in guts. There was also a weak positive correlation between pH in bays and mean methylmercury concentrations in carcasses. The ratio of methylmercury to inorganic mercury decreased with increasing total mercury concentration in guts and in larvae, but the rate of decrease was highly variable among bays. Ratios of concentrations in carcasses to concentrations in guts were inversely related to gut concentration. Mercury concentrations in carcasses in some bays were within the range of concentrations at which adverse effects have been observed in laboratory studies of R. sphenocephala. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hydrological conditions on a site constitute one of the many factors that may affect the availability of potentially toxic trace metals for uptake by plants. Bioavailability of Cd, Mn and Zn in a contaminated dredged sediment-derived soil under different hydrological regimes was determined by measuring metal uptake by the wetland plant species Salix cinerea, both in field circumstances and in a greenhouse experiment. Longer submersion periods in the field caused lower Cd concentrations in leaves and bark. The wetland hydrological regime in the greenhouse experiment resulted in normal Cd and Zn concentrations in the leaves, while the upland hydrological regime resulted in elevated Cd and Zn concentrations in the leaves. Field observations and the greenhouse experiment suggest that a hydrological regime that creates or sustains a wetland is a potential management option that reduces metal bioavailability to willows. This would constitute a safe management option of metal-polluted, willow-dominated wetlands provided that wetland conditions can be maintained throughout the full growing season.

AB A water treatment unit, mainly consisting of free water surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) constructed wetland cells, was integrated into a commercial-scale recirculating aquaculture system for intensive shrimp culture. This study investigated performance of the treatment wetlands for controlling water quality. The results showed that the FWS-SF cells effectively removed total suspended solids (55-66%), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (37-54%), total ammonia (64-66%) and nitrite (83-94%) from the recirculating water under high hydraulic loading rates (1.57-1.95 m/day). This led to a water quality that was suitable for shrimp culture and effluent that always satisfied the discharge standards. The area ratios of wetlands to culture tank being demonstrated (0.43) and calculated (0.096) in this study were both significantly lower than the reported values. Accordingly, a constructed wetland was technically and economically feasible for managing water quality of an intensive aquaculture system. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several wetland plant species appear to have constitutive metal tolerance. In previous studies, populations from contaminated and non-contaminated sites of the wetland plants Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, Glyceria fluitans and Eriophorum angustifolium were found to be tolerant to high concentrations of metals. This study screened three other species of wetland plants: Alisma plantago-aquatica, Carex rostrata and Phalaris arundinacea for innate tolerance to zinc. The degree of tolerance was compared to known zinc-tolerant E. angustifolium and Festuca rubra Merlin. It was found that A. plantago-aquatica and P. arundinacea did not posses innate tolerance to zinc, but that C. rostrata was able to tolerate elevated levels of zinc, at levels comparable to those tolerated by E. angustifolium and F. rubra Merlin. The findings support the theory that some wetland angiosperm species tend to be tolerant to exposure to high levels of metals, regardless of their origin. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rhodamine-WT and LiCl were compared for their suitability as hydraulic tracers in wetlands. Using outdoor mesocosms, we found lithium to be more conservative than rhodamine-WT when initial concentrations were 4.9 to 64 mu g/L for rhodamine-WT and 28-516 mu g/L for Li+ (1:6 to 1:8 (wt/wt) ratio of rhodamine-WT to Li+). At higher initial concentrations (i.e., 100 mu g/L for rhodamine-WT and 1000 mu g/L for Li+), both tracers returned more than 95% of the injected amount in submerged aquatic vegetation-dominated mesocosms; rhodamine-WT was returned at only 74-75% in cattail-dominated mesocosms. Batch studies using different sediment substrates exposed to direct sunlight and shade indicated that Li+ was less affected by adsorption and microbial processes than was rhodamine-WT at low initial tracer concentrations of each (4.9 and 19.4 mu g/L for rhodamine-WT and 28 and 106 mu g/L for Li+). Both rhodamine-WT and Li+ desorb back to the water column in small amounts. The extent of adsorption losses by rhodamine-WT depended on the organic matter content of the sediment and the extent of photolysis. Even though rhodanmine-WT was not as stable as LiCl at initial concentrations less than 60 mu g/L, the reduction in the recoveries did not affect the accuracy of key hydraulic parameters (hydraulic retention time, dispersion, tanks-in-series, and wetland dispersion numbers) derived from the method of moments analysis as long as a discernible concentration-time response still existed. This is because the tracer losses were approximately zero-order and irreversible.

AB Managed impoundments, a form of structural marsh management, have been used to enhance plant production in the rapidly-eroding marshes of coastal Louisiana, USA, yet few studies have quantified their effects by measuring plant production before and after impoundment construction. We tested the effects of structural marsh management on the annual aboveground production and plant stand structure (stem density and stem height) of Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus by collecting measurements before and after the construction of two shallow impoundments. We manipulated the water level in each impoundment by adjusting a single flap-gated culvert fitted with a variable crest weir. Because nutria herbivory also seemed to have a strong influence on plant production in these marshes, we tested the effects of nutria herbivory on the annual aboveground production and plant stand structure of both plant species by collecting data from fenced (ungrazed) and unfenced (grazed) plots located in both managed and unmanaged areas. There were no significant differences in Spartina annual production, stem density, and stem height between managed and unmanaged areas, and Schoenoplectus annual production, stem density, and stem height were greater in unmanaged marsh, indicating that the management method used in this study was not effective in promoting plant production in the rapidly-eroding, brackish, deltaic marshes of coastal Louisiana. Nutria herbivory dramatically reduced the annual aboveground production, stem density, and stem height of Schoenoplectus, a preferred forage species, and thus altered the structure of the mixed species stand. Herbivory had no significant effect on the annual aboveground production and stem density of Spartina. In the absence of herbivory, the stem height of Spartina increased significantly and coincided with significant increases in the stem density and height of Schoenoplectus. The changes in plant stand structure caused by nutria herbivory may facilitate marsh erosion and ultimately contribute to wetland loss.

AB Wetland mitigation banking is the practice of creating, restoring, enhancing, or preserving large, off-site wetlands to compensate for authorized impacts to natural wetlands. By 2002, there were 219 active mitigation banks in the United States, encompassing 50,000 hectares in 29 states. This study is the first systematic analysis of the ecological quality of these ecosystems; the objective is to determine if mitigation banks are successfully supporting native wetland vegetation and if success differs by mitigation method (created, restored, or enhanced), geomorphic class, age, or area. I obtained monitoring reports from 45 randomly selected mitigation bank wetlands in 21 states to evaluate three measures of ecological status: the prevalence of wetland vegetation, the pervasiveness of non-native species, and plant species richness. Sites range from less than one ha to over 560 ha and include 17 created wetlands, 19 restored wetlands, and 9 enhanced wetlands. Prevalence Index scores (PI; 1.0 for obligate wetland vegetation to 5.0 for upland vegetation) do not differ by wetland area but are significantly lower in created wetlands and significantly decrease from one- and two-year-old created wetlands (PI=2.37 +/- 0.15; mean +/- SE) to those five to seven years old (PI=1.96 +/- 0.12). Created and restored wetlands support 12.4 and 12.2 species per 10 m(2) respectively, nearly four times more than the 3.2 species in 10 m(2) of enhanced wetland. This is in part attributable to a greater incidence of non-native species in created and restored wetlands. The vegetative cover in created mitigation bank wetlands is 18.9 +/- 2.8 percent non-native-statistically similar to that of restored (17.6 +/- 2.9) but significantly greater than that of enhanced systems (8.7 +/- 2.7). Within mitigation methods, there are clear differences among geomorphic and vegetation classes. Depressional systems with a single vegetation class support highly hydrophytic, highly non-native communities with low species richness, while restored and enhanced riverine systems have a greater prevalence of native species. For mitigation bank wetlands in this study, the prevalence of wetland vegetation, the representation of native species, and the plant community homogeneity increase with age, indicating a period of self-organization and a potential trend toward vegetative equivalence with natural wetlands.

AB Despite concern about the conservation status of amphibians in western North America, few field studies have documented occurrence patterns of amphibians relative to potential stressors. We surveyed wetland fauna in Oregon's Willamette Valley and used an information theoretic approach (AIC) to rank the associations between native amphibian breeding occurrence and wetland characteristics, non-native aquatic predators, and landscape characteristics in a mixed urban-agricultural landscape. Best predictors varied among the five native amphibians and were generally consistent with life history differences. Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) and long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) occurrence was best predicted by the absence of non-native fish. Northern red-legged frog (Rana a. aurora) and northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) were most strongly related to wetland vegetative characteristics. The occurrence of rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), a migratory species that makes extensive use of terrestrial habitats, was best predicted by greater forest cover within 1 km. The absence of non-native fish was a strong predictor of occurrence for four of the five native species. In contrast, amphibians were not strongly related to native fish presence. We found little evidence supporting negative effects of the presence of breeding populations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) on any native species. Only the two Ambystoma salamanders were associated with wetland permanence. Northwestern salamanders (which usually have a multi-year larval stage) were associated with permanent waters, while long-toed salamanders were associated with temporary wetlands. Although all the species make some use of upland habitats, only one (rough-skinned newt) was strongly associated with surrounding landscape conditions. Instead, our analysis suggests that within-wetland characteristics best predict amphibian occurrence in this region. We recommend that wetland preservation and mitigation efforts concentrate on sites lacking non-native fish for the conservation of native amphibians in the Willamette Valley and other western lowlands.

AB The coastal plain of northern Belize consists of relatively undisturbed freshwater marshes that are strongly phosphorus-limited and characterized by monodominant stands or mixtures of emergent macrophytes. In order to assess the impact of agricultural activities on the nutrient dynamics and plant species composition in adjacent wetlands, we sampled along transects in 40 marshes - 20 located downslope from agricultural fields and 20 bordered by scrub or broadleaf forest. Soil, water, and plant tissue samples were collected for nutrient analyses, and plant species composition was recorded at points along transects during both the wet and dry seasons. Marshes downslope from agricultural activity had significantly greater percent cover of Typha domingensis, a competitive dominant in the system (20% vs. 6%) and significantly more soil phosphorus (128-144 mu g*cm(-3)) than marshes bordered by forest (70-98 mu g*cm(-3)). Plant tissue P content was positively correlated with soil P content but not with soil N for Typha (r=0.55) and Eleocharis spp. (r=0.72). Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identified soil P as the variable most strongly affecting Typha abundance. Abundance of species common to unimpacted marshes (Eleocharis spp., Cladium jamaicense) was negatively correlated with soil P. Further intensification of agriculture in this region may result in expansion of T domingensis, as has occurred in the Florida Everglades.

   ECOLOGY
AB We studied the distribution and abundance of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus near two aquaculture facilities for two years in coastal wetlands in southeastern Mississippi, USA. In 280 collections, we represented 29 families, 65 taxa, and 86,415 fishes with a variety of gear types. Oreochromis niloticus ranked sixth in abundance overall and ranked second among those stations sampled in the Pascagoula River watershed and sixteenth among Coastal River stations. Water temperature downstream from the facility effluents was always warmer than ambient, and at the Pascagoula River facility, it never dropped below 15.1 degrees C over the three years examined. Thus, normal environmental conditions, the presence of the downstream thermal refuge, and the generally low salinity of the bayous of our region all combine to provide a quality environment for continued survival of released fish. Furthermore, O. niloticus seem to spawn year-round, and fish as small as 79.9 mm TL were found to carry mature eggs, suggesting that, if they are born early in the season, they could reproduce during their first summer of life. Further spread of O. niloticus and introduction of new species are expected as aquaculture expands. The philosophy that allows the escape or release of non-indigenous taxa into our present landscape, justified by the belief that species will not survive or become established, is fallible.

AB Wetland destruction has plagued the U.S. for decades, but the need to compensate for these losses has only been embraced within the last 20 years. Because so many compensatory mitigation wetlands have been created, there is a need to assess the function of these valuable ecosystems relative to natural wetlands. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional equivalency of mitigation wetlands in West Virginia in supporting hydrophytic plant communities. A series of nested quadrats was used to compare plant community structure among eleven mitigation and four naturally occurring reference wetlands. For all species combined, mean total percent cover across all sampling quadrats per wetland was similar between mitigation and reference wetlands. Species richness, evenness, and diversity were greater in mitigation than in reference wetlands. Mean weighted averages of plant communities calculated using cover values and wetland indicator status were similar between mitigation and reference wetlands. There were, however, major differences in species composition. Mitigation sites tended to have more pioneer species, non-native dominants, and species with relatively lower conservation quality. Ordination analyses suggested that compositional differences become smaller as mitigation sites age. Both mitigation and natural wetlands met criteria for hydrophytic vegetation according to the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual. These data suggest that the mitigation wetlands investigated in this study adequately support hydrophytic vegetation and appear to be developing vegetation similar to reference standards.

AB We analyzed the transverse pattern of vegetation along a reach of the Fremont River in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA using models that support both delineation of wetland extent and projection of the changes in wetland area resulting from upstream hydrologic alteration. We linked stage-discharge relations developed by a hydraulic model to a flow-duration curve derived from the flow history in order to calculate the inundation duration of 361 plots (0.5 X 2 m). Logistic regression was used to relate plant species occurrence in plots to inundation duration. A weighted average of the wetland indicator values of species was used to characterize plots as Aquatic, Wetland, Transitional, or Upland. Finally, we assessed how alterations in the flow duration curve would change the relative widths of these four zones. The wetland indicator values of species and the wetland prevalence index scores of plots were strongly correlated with inundation duration. Our results support the concept that plants classified as wetland species typically occur on sites inundated at least two weeks every two years. The portion of the riparian zone along the high-gradient study reach of the Fremont River that satisfied the vegetation criterion for a regulatory wetland was narrow (2 m wide). Both the unvegetated Aquatic zone (7.8 m) and the Transitional zone (8 m) were substantially wider. The Transitional zone included the maxima of several species and was, therefore, not merely a combination of elements of the Wetland and Upland zones. Multiplicative increases or decreases in streamflow regime produced a wetter, or drier, bottomland vegetation, respectively. Systematic reductions in flow variability reduced the width of both the Wetland and Transitional zones and increased the width of the Upland zone. Our approach is widely applicable to inform, water management decisions involving changes in flow regime.

AB Greenhouse studies using soil-plant plugs extracted from a Spartina patens marsh receiving diverted Mississippi River water shows that lowering of salinity and increased nutrient input associated with freshwater reintroduction into Louisiana estuaries will enhance nutrient uptake and biomass production of wiregrass (Spartina patens). Biomass production doubled in response to the addition of 10g N m(-2). A salinity-nutrient interaction was shown. Plants grown in fertilized treatments at 0 ppt had significantly greater biomass production than plants grown under fertilized treatment and 8 ppt salinity. However, a significantly greater amount of biomass was measured in both fertilized treatments (0 and 8 ppt) as compared to control. Lowering of salinity alone also stimulated plant growth. Results demonstrated that proposed reintroduction of Mississippi River water into Spartina patens marshes of Breton Sound should enhance plant growth and improve marsh stability.

AB The practice of wetland mitigation has come into question during the past decade because the relative capacity of the mitigated wetlands to perform normal wetland functions is mostly unknown. In this study, we wanted to determine whether soil microbial communities were significantly different in early successional mitigated wetlands (< 10 years) (ES) compared to late successional bottomland hardwood forest wetlands (LS) due to differences in soil properties, such as carbon quality and storage and water-holding capacity. Carbon storage in litter and soil was 1.5 times greater in LS wetlands than ES wetlands. Soil water-holding capacity was significantly greater in LS wetlands and was related to soil organic C content (r(2)=0.87, p-value=0.0007). Gravimetric water content was a moderately strong predictor of microbial respiration (r(2)=0.55-0.61, p-value=0.001-0.0004) and microbial biomass (r(2)=0.70, p-value=0.0019). Anaerobic microbial groups were enriched in soils from LS wetlands in both the dry and wet seasons, which suggested that LS soils were wetter for longer periods of the year than ES soils. The capacity of these wetlands to support anaerobic microbial processes depends on soil water retention characteristics, which were dictated by organic matter content. As an integrator of microbial growth conditions in soils, determination of microbial community composition by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis may be an important new tool for monitoring successional development of compensatory mitigation wetlands.

AB Understanding the hydrologic patterns in vast wetland ecosystems has proven to be a difficult task. Most of the world's wetland ecosystems are not adequately monitored for water level, flow, or discharge, and where these are monitored, gauges are usually located on the largest rivers or lakes and canals rather than in the seasonally flooded areas. Even those wetlands that have the most extensive networks of gauges are not sufficiently covered to understand the finer-scale spatial dynamics of hydrologic condition. However, high-density in situ monitoring of stage, flow, and discharge of vast wetland complexes would be prohibitively expensive, even in a region such as south Florida, USA where considerable resources are devoted to water management. Several techniques are presented that were developed to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to remotely detect, monitor, and map regional scale spatial and temporal changes in wetland hydrology. This study shows that SAR imagery can be used to create inundation maps of relative soil moisture and flooding in non-woody wetlands. A comparison of in situ water-level data collected from 1997 to 1999 at 12 test sites to SAR imagery revealed that relative backscatter within a site does vary in a linear fashion with changes in water levels. Using SAR imagery collected between 1997 and 1999, inundation maps were created at approximately bi-monthly periods for the south Florida region. This time series of inundation/soil moisture maps (1997-1999) reveals the spatial and temporal variation in degree of flooding in the Greater Everglades, which is information previously unavailable from ground-based observations alone. In addition, hydroperiod maps were created based on a temporal series of 14 months of SAR imagery.

AB In the Adirondack region of nor-them New York, USA, Alnus incana ssp. rugosa and Myrica gale often dominate wetland shrub communities and fix nitrogen in symbiosis with actinomycetes of the genus Frankia. The objective of this study was to examine the contribution of these shrubs to the N economies of whole wetlands in the Adirondacks where N has been considered a potential pollutant and contributor to low acid-neutralizing capacity, and where N deposition may reduce rates of nitrogen fixation in actinorhizal plants. Nitrogen chemistry of plant foliage was examined, and density and foliar biomass of nitrogen fixing shrubs were estimated in plots or belt transects in six shrub wetlands near atmospheric deposition monitoring stations in order to estimate the fraction of N derived from fixation in A. incana ssp. rugosa and M. gale tissues. Lake-inlet-wetlands were dominated by alder that derives >= 85% foliar N from fixation, but M. gale was most abundant in lake outlet wetlands and seemed to rely less on fixed N, although results for Myrica were more uncertain. Substantial N is therefore added to lake inlet systems dominated by alder (7-18 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), while N fixed from M. gale does not appear to exceed 3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), except in localized patches at smaller spatial scales. Similarity in delta(15)N between non-fixing field shrubs and reference values for fixed N at some sites suggests that fixed N is being recycled in the plant community. Wet atmospheric N deposition is 3-6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and does not decrease N fixation substantially in alder. Overall, shrubs in wetlands dominated by these actinorhizal N-2-fixing plants are not taking up substantial quantities of anthropogenic N, suggesting that nitrogen is processed microbially or transferred along with some fixed N to downstream ecosystems.

AB This study examined chironomid responses to the flooding of ten drained experimental marshes in Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. Emergence traps were used to monitor chironomid emergence from three vegetation types (Symphyotrichum ciliatum, Scolochloa festucacea, and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) flooded at two water depths (shallow: 20-40 cm, deep: 50-70 cm) over a four-year period. The greatest number (7,651 m(-2) yr(-1)) and biomass (20.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) of chironomids emerged from Schoenoplectus-deep sites in the fourth year of flooding. Numbers, biomass, and size classes of emerging chironomids were similar over the four years from the Symphyotrichum habitat. However, chironomid emergence from Scolochloa and Schoenoplectus habitats was dominated initially by the smallest size class but shifted steadily toward production of much larger species over the four-year experiment. The production of chironomids as a potential food resource for waterfowl was high from the Symphyotrichum habitat during all four years of flooding, but emergence from the Scolochloa and Schoenoplectus habitats did not reach comparable levels until the third or fourth year.

AB I assessed the relationship between ostracod occurrence and ecological variables in the Yumrukaya reedbeds (Bolu, Turkey), describing how differences in water conditions affected the composition of ostracod assemblages in this small freshwater wetland. Between May 2000 and July 2002, seven ostracod taxa (Cypridopsis vidua, Ilyocypris bradyi, I. gibba, Heterocypris incongruens, Eucypris virens, Candona neglecta, Pseudocandona sp.) were collected. All the ostracods had cosmopolitan characteristics, with broad ranges of tolerance to the variations in ecological variables and the capacity to either resist desiccation or to recolonize newly flooded habitats. The number of ostracods found in Yumrukaya reedbeds was about 50% lower than the average number of ostracods in similar sized habitats of Turkey. The Unweighted Pair Group Mean Averages (UPGMA) clustering analysis based on presence/absence data displayed three groups of ostracods and suggested that cosmopolitan species might have similar life cycles and ecological preferences. Correlation analyses indicated that salinity and percent oxygen saturation were significantly associated with species richness.

AB In this work, we propose a new tagging technique to evaluate NAPP in Scirpus giganteus (bulrush), a species commonly found in freshwater marshes of South America. Through this method, a total mean NAPP of 1514.12 +/- 305.11 g m(-2) year(-1) (C.V.= 20%) was obtained by a combination of tagging and harvesting entire mats. A maximum living biomass of 1063.60 +/- 362.06 g m(-2) (C.V.= 34%) was registered in February (late summer), which would be the estimation of the total annual NAPP using the traditional peak standing crop method and gives an underestimation of NAPP because it neither considers mortality before the peak biomass is attained, nor does it include any production after peak. As there are no statistically significant changes in the mean living biomass on different sampling dates (df=9, F=2.22, p > 0.10), which is an expected situation in a species that grows through the whole year, methods based on changes in living and dead biomass are difficult to apply. The proposed tagging method gives an estimate of NAPP for a species on which more widely used procedures cannot be applied. Moreover, the tagging technique may be applicable for a great number of emergent wetland plants showing similar growth forms.

AB Agricultural drainage ditches in the Mississippi Alluvial Delta landscape vary from edge-of-field waterways to sizeable drainages. Ditch attributes vary with size, location and maintenance and may aid in mitigation of contaminants from agricultural fields. The goal of this study was to better understand how vegetative characteristics affect water quality in conveyance structures in the context of ditch class and surrounding land use. Characterization of 36 agricultural ditches included presence of riparian buffer strips, water depth, surrounding land use, vegetative cover, and associated aqueous physicochemical parameters. Vegetation was assessed quantitatively, obtaining stem counts in a sub-sample of ditch sites, using random quadrat method. Physical features varied with ditch size and vegetative diversity was higher in larger structures. Polygonum sp. was the dominant bed vegetation and was ubiquitous among site sizes. Macrophytes varied from aquatic to upland species, and included Leersia sp. and upland grasses (Poaceae family) in all drainage size classes. Percent cover of bed and bank varied from 0 to 100% and 70 to 100%, respectively, and highest nutrient values were measured in sites with no buffer strips. These conveyance structures and surrounding buffer zones are being ranked for their ability to reduce excess nutrients, suspended solids, and pesticides associated with runoff. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forested wetlands in metropolitan areas function to support biodiversity, protect water quality, store floodwaters, and maintain streamflow, but they also function to provide natural areas for passive recreation, education, and esthetic appreciation for the surrounding human populations. However, the presence of dense human populations in the watersheds of wetlands is usually associated with disturbance and the diminution of the capacity of the wetlands to provide socially-valued ecological functions. I have examined indicators of biological, hydrologic, biogeochemical, and social functions in a sample of twenty-one mature forested wetlands located in northeastern New Jersey, USA, part of the New York City metropolitan region, which supports over 2000 people km(-2). The field data and the principal components analyses of the sets of indicator variables for each class of function showed that the wetlands were arrayed along well-defined complex gradients in each case and that some functions were being performed at high levels in some of the wetlands despite the urban setting. However, the arrangement of sites within each ordination space differed, suggesting complex relationships among the various functions, some of which may be contradictory. For example, high ability to store floodwaters and evidence of flooding is associated with greater plant diversity and presence of obligate wetland species but is also associated with poor habitat for vertebrates and the presence of water-borne trash and exotic species. Conversely, low wetness is associated with high quality of habitat for vertebrates but also increased disturbance from large-scale dumping of trash and human disturbance and the release of nitrate from the soils. High levels of human use in and around the wetlands, while providing opportunity for human use and appreciation of the sites, is associated with low plant diversity and high release of nitrate-nitrogen. I conclude that because the functions performed by urban wetlands include human use and presence, there will necessarily be trade-offs required among ecological and human functions.

AB Long-term studies are essential to understanding the effects of urbanization on wetlands and the effectiveness of management actions. Using data from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) in combination with GIS analyses and field surveys, we tracked changes over 16 years (1982-1998) in small (less than or equal to2 ha), palustrine emergent/open water wetlands (PEM/POW) in Portland, Oregon, USA. Wetlands identified on NWI maps and that had not been converted to other land uses at the time of the 1992 survey were surveyed in 1998. Data were collected on 164 of the 171 wetlands in the target population. Despite development pressure throughout the 1990s, loss of small PEM/POW wetlands slowed between 1992 and 1998, with only 6% of the sites being destroyed as compared to 40% between 1982 and 1992. Of 11 sites that were not identifiable due to drought in 1992, eight had recovered with the return of typical rainfall; three had been destroyed. Most of the wetlands existing in 1998 were in hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes atypical to the region due to human manipulation. Hydrologic modifications were observed on 60% of the sites, but on-site disturbances like mowing, dumping, and trail building had decreased since the 1992 survey. Over the time period studied, land uses adjacent to the study sites shifted from undeveloped and agricultural to urban and residential use. Reflecting the common occurrence of on- and off-site stressors and modifications, we rated the condition of only 11 % of the sites as good, with 46% fair and 43 % poor. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining field surveys with GIS analyses to track the status of wetland resources over time. The next challenge is to use such data to develop strategies to manage urban wetlands in ways that maintain and ultimately improve the condition of the resource.

AB Wetlands provide a range of valuable ecosystem services from water purification and nutrient retention to recreation and aesthetics. The value of these services is often difficult to quantify and document to policy makers and the general public. Economists have developed non-market approaches to address difficult issues related to valuation of the environment. This paper reviews recent literature on non-market valuation as applied to wetlands, with a particular focus on the value of urban wetlands. Wetland valuation studies have generated a wide range of values, in part due to differences in what is valued and in part due to differences in methodology. Several studies have shown that property owners value proximity to wetlands in urban areas. In addition, studies have found positive values for recreation (fishing and hunting), commercial fishing, water purification, and other ecosystem services provided by wetlands, although little of this work has been done on urban wetlands. Valuation studies can provide useful information about relative rankings of value, showing, for example, that certain types of wetlands or certain services are more highly valued than others. Whether the absolute magnitude of valuation estimates is correct is less clear.

AB In an interdisciplinary project to develop protocols for long-term cultural and ecological monitoring of wetland restorations in Minnesota, we compared restored and reference wetlands on several ecological and cultural measures including land-use context, cultural perceptions, and management practices. Cultural measures were drawn from our surveys of visitors, neighbors, planners, and managers of the wetlands. This paper discusses their perceptions of six metropolitan wetlands (four recent restorations and two reference sites), how cultural measures of their perceptions compared with selected site characteristics and biodiversity measures, and what results suggest for wetland design and management. Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition, objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape context, were related to perceived attractiveness. While plant species richness was not significantly related to perceived wetland attractiveness for our sites, bird species richness was related to attractiveness.

AB Alkaline wetland beaches provide crucial habitat for breeding piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) in the northern Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Vegetation encroachment has been identified as a potential threat that decreases alkaline beach habitat availability, but the long-term status of these breeding habitats has not been evaluated. We measured vegetation changes at two North Dakota alkaline wetland complexes from 1938 to 1997. Total beach habitat, including lower beaches that were impacted by flooding, varied substantially among years based on changes in surface-water levels. Quantities of upper-beach habitats, which were not affected by inundation, were negatively correlated with precipitation amounts during the previous five-year periods. We measured declines in upper-beach habitat averaging 0.89 ha/yr and 0.20ha/yr at our two wetland complexes from 1938 to 1997, suggesting that long-term changes in factors other than precipitation (e.g., ground-water hydrology, livestock grazing intensity, or fire frequency) may be negatively affecting beach availability. Vegetation reduction may be critical to long-term recovery of threatened piping plovers in the Great Plains.

AB Larvae of wetland caddisflies supplement their detrital diets with animal material. In some species this supplement is obtained by preying on other caddisflies. In this study, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to a) compare intraspecific aggression and the propensity for cannibalism among six caddisfly species that occur along a gradient from vernal to autumnal to permanent high-elevation wetlands, and b) determine the importance of cases in preventing or reducing cannibalism and intraguild predation. We predicted that cannibalism and overall levels of aggression should be highest in species that occur in temporary habitats. We found that all of the species that use temporary habitats (Asynarchus nigriculus, Hesperophylax occidentalis, Limnephilus externus, Limnephilus picturatus, Limnephilus secludens) were extremely aggressive towards and cannibalized conspecitics without cases. Species that typically occur in short-duration temporary wetlands were more aggressive than those in long-duration temporary wetlands. Cases prevented cannibalism in four of these temporary-habitat species, and reduced cannibalism among Asynarchus larvae. The latter species occurs in extremely ephemeral habitats where cannibalism provides a dietary supplement that probably facilitates emergence before drying. Asynarchus also preys on Limnephilus spp., and we found that cases dramatically reduced vulnerability to intraguild predation. Larvae of Agrypnia deflata, a species that occurs only in permanent wetlands, were least aggressive and rarely cannibalized conspecifics. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that intraspecific aggression and the potential for cannibalism are highest in species that live in habitats with developmental time constraints. Many wetland invertebrates face developmental time constraints and selection for aggression in temporary habitats should be especially strong for taxa that rely on animal material to supplement a mainly detrital diet.

AB Ectomycorrhizae are symbiotic relationships between soil fungi and higher plants. Evidence of the symbiosis is the presence of a 'mantle,' a hyphal layer that covers root tips, and a change in root morphology. The potential use of ectomycorrhizal mantles as hydrology indicators for wetland determinations was evaluated on the Delmarva Coastal Plain (Delaware and eastern shores of Maryland and Virginia, USA) over three seasons. In theory, the distribution of mantles with soil depth should vary from uplands to wetlands in most years, as mantle development is considered to be impeded by anaerobic conditions. At four forested locations, plots were set up in seasonally-saturated wetlands and adjacent uplands and drained wetlands (twelve sub-sites). Plots were evaluated according to the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual for soils, plant community, and hydrology to identify a jurisdictional classification. Hydrology was further addressed using automated monitoring wells (twice daily readings), and anaerobic conditions were confirmed via platinum electrodes. Plant roots (Pinus taeda was targeted) were sampled via spade slices in March and August each year and separated by depth: 0 horizon, 0-5 cm, 510 cm, 10-15 cm, and 15-20 cm. Roots were evaluated for the presence of mantles. A threshold depth of 5 cm was identified. From a total of 892 roots with mantles in uplands (including effectively-drained wetland sub-sites), 253 (28%) were found below the threshold depth. For wetlands (including one ineffectively-drained wetland), seven of 331 roots with mantles (2%) were found below the threshold depth. Temporal and spatial variability in mantle data was common; however, mantles consistently occurred at greater depths where seasonally high water tables were lower. We concluded that mantle depth has potential as a hydrology indicator.

AB Wetland mulching is the transfer of surface soil (often from a wetland that will be filled or otherwise impacted) onto the surface of a wetland creation area to provide wetland vegetation, organic matter, and soil organisms. A total of 33 herbaceous wetland creation areas (17 mulched and 16 non-mulched) in the Tampa, Florida, USA region were studied at the end of the wet season (November) and subsequent dry season (June) to determine the effects of mulching. All wetland creation areas were constructed between 5 and I I years prior to the study. Using the seasonally flooded zone of each wetland, we examined the effects that mulching has on 1) percent organic matter in the soil, 2) the Prevalence Index (measure of hydrophytic vegetation occurrence) of plant communities present, 3) species richness, evenness, and diversity (Shannon Index), 4) total vegetation cover, 5) above-ground biomass production, 6) soil pH, and 7) nutrient content. Mulched wetlands had a higher percent organic matter in the soil than non-mulched wetlands (5.9 +/- 0.5% vs. 2.6 +/- 0.3%, respectively). In November, the mulched wetlands had lower Prevalence Index values, species richness, and diversity values than non-mulched wetlands. Between November and June, non-mulched wetlands decreased in species richness (10.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.6 +/- 0.6 per m(2)) and overall diversity (Shannon Index values 1.74 +/- 0.08 to 1.28 +/- 0.10), while no change in diversity was detected for mulched wetlands. In a subsample of wetland sites, the concentrations of secondary macro-elements (Mg, Ca, and K) were greater in the mulched than in non-mulched wetlands. No significant differences were detected for primary nutrients (NO3-N and P), soil pH, or above-ground plant biomass. Even 5-10 years after construction, initial mulching still seems to still have an influence on ecosystem development in these created wetlands.

TI Disturbance and the three parameters of wetland delineation

AB Under current U.S. wetland delineation procedures, an area must have hydric soils, wetland hydrology, and hydrophytic vegetation to be considered a wetland. This study investigated the level of correlation between these three parameters on sites disturbed by humans versus relatively undisturbed sites. Based on our data set of nearly 1,800 data points from 188 sites in northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana, USA, relatively "disturbed" locations are significantly less likely to meet all three wetland criteria than "undisturbed" locations. Disturbance also affects an area's likelihood to meet or fail particular wetland parameters, depending on the type of disturbance. Also, areas dominated by common hydrophytic species are significantly less likely to meet all three wetland criteria in disturbed areas versus undisturbed areas. This study suggests the need for quantitative studies of the three wetland criteria on both disturbed and undisturbed sites to refine further the USFWS wetness ratings and hydric soil field indicators relative to the effects of disturbance.

AB Seasonal wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain in southwestern Australia often dry in summer, refill during heavy winter rains, and are commonly surrounded by vegetated catchments. However, the linkage between catchment litter turnover and lake P dynamics is poorly understood. A transect from catchment uplands to the dry lakebed of Thomsons Lake was studied with the progression of the wet season. Attention was given to 1) levels of litter-P release at various sites; 2) spatial patterns of soil P along a wet to dry transect; and 3) dynamic changes in soil P availability in response to changing hydrologic conditions. Phosphorus detained in situ by anion exchange membranes and changes in AEM-extractable P (AEM-P) in surface soils indicated that the first heavy rainfall of the wet season generated significant P loads from catchment litter. In contrast, there was little P released in bare soils without litter. Before rain, soil AEM-P in the lakebed and fringing areas was low, but this increased by 3.4-56 times in the wet season. There was a net decrease in AEM-extractable P, total P, and organic C in the upland catchment but an increase in the wetland during the wet season. The results suggest that heavy rains after six months of drying may generate significant P flux from catchment litter. This would be followed by further leaching and an inferred stimulation of microbial activity during the progress of the wet season. The large increase in AEM-P in lake sites appears related to the input of P from catchment sites through hydrologic processes during the rains and an internal process associated with a 'drying-rewetting' effect.

AB The landscape within the Chesapeake Bay watershed has been and continues to be impacted by human modifications. Understanding if such anthropogenic disturbances influence organisms that are dependent upon estuarine wetlands remains unclear. We developed an index of marsh bird community integrity (IMBCI) to evaluate marsh bird communities and wetland condition. During the 2002 and 2003 summers, we detected 30 bird species at 219 point count locations distributed among 96 wetlands. lMBCI scores for each wetland were used to determine whether wetland habitat characteristics and urban/suburban development, agriculture, and forest at three different spatial scales (watershed, 1000-m buffer, and 500-m buffer) influenced marsh bird community integrity. We found no relationship between lMBCI scores and wetland habitat characteristics, implying that marsh bird community integrity is not related to any single plant community. Nonparametric changepoint analysis indicated that marsh bird community integrity was significantly reduced when the amount of urban/suburban development within 500 m and 1000 m of the marsh exceeded 14% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect of urban/suburban development on lMBCI scores at the watershed scale. The results of our study demonstrate that marsh bird community integrity shows a threshold response to urban/suburban development at local scales. lMBCI scores, combined with the identification of a land-use threshold, can be easy to interpret and may help communicate complex ecological data to natural resource managers and conservation planners.

AB Santa Olalla is a Mediterranean permanent coastal shallow lake, with high annual solar irradiation and warm water temperature throughout the year. Ecosystem metabolism, chlorophyll a concentrations, and physical and chemical features were studied in the Santa Olalla lake from March 1998 to February 2000. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and community respiration (CR) were determined using a modification of the one-station diel oxygen change method. Chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and total phosphorous and nitrogen reveal Santa Olalla to be a hypereutrophic system. Values of GPP and CR were very high (average 7.88 g O(2) m(-2) d(-1) and 8.52 g O(2) m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Principal components analysis and a multiple regression model showed photosynthetically active radiation and soluble reactive phosphorus to be the main factors that control primary production in Santa Olalla. Also, the annual and interannual variation of water level in Santa Olalla seems to be an important factor that influences the ecological processes of this system. Mean net daily metabolism during a hydrologic period was not statistically different from 0 (0.008 g O(2) m(-2) d(-1), p = 0.99), and the average P/R ratio was not statistically different from 1 (1.164, p = 0.343). These results suggest that the primary productivity was balanced with community respiration in Santa Olalla lake. The high values of metabolic rates and low nutrient concentrations in this aquatic ecosystem suggest a quick recycling of nutrients, which were assimilated almost instantaneously after mineralization.

   EVOLUTION
AB Metal tolerance in plants is thought to evolve following exposure to elevated metal levels in the soil. However, there are examples of species that appear to have developed constitutive metal tolerance without apparent exposure to metals. In previous studies, populations from contaminated and non-contaminated sites of the wetland plants Typha latifolia, Phrogmites australis, and Glyceria fluitans were found to be equally tolerant to high concentrations of metals. In this study, zinc uptake and growth responses of populations of Eriophorum angustifolium, Juncus effusus, and Juncus articulatus from zinc-contaminated and non-contaminated sites were compared as part of a research project investigating metal tolerance in wetland plants. The populations were grown hydroponically in zinc-amended nutrient solutions. Juncus articulatus could not grow in the presence of elevated zinc concentrations, and no growth differences between populations were observed. Both populations of Juncus effusus from contaminated and non-contaminated sites grew well in moderately elevated zinc concentrations, but growth was inhibited at the higher treatment levels. Growth of Eriophorum angustifolium was inhibited less than growth of Juncus effusus at the higher zinc treatment levels. Both populations were able to tolerate concentrations of zinc of up to 1000 mumol L-1. The findings for Juncus effusus and Eriophorum angustifolium support the theory that wetland plants tend to be tolerant to exposure to high levels of metals, but the results for Juncus articulatus suggest that this is not a general rule.

AB Pitfall trapping of terrestrial invertebrates in and around a seasonal woodland pond in northern Minnesota, USA revealed that large numbers of detritivorous and predaceous invertebrates from the forest floor were entering the pond as it dried. To assess the significance of terrestrial invertebrate foraging on litter processing and survival of aestivating aquatic invertebrates in dry pond basins, a small-scale exclusion study was conducted at two seasonal woodland ponds. Litter and invertebrates collected beneath pond waters were added to either 1-mm-mesh pouches (30 x 30 x 5 cm) that excluded large-bodied terrestrial invertebrates or 12-mm-mesh reference pouches that permitted entry. Pouches were left in dry basins for four weeks. Upon retrieval, I found that more aestivating aquatic invertebrates existed in exclusion than reference pouches (P < 0.001), suggesting that predation from terrestrial invertebrates might influence aquatic forms. Impacts of excluding detritivorous terrestrial invertebrates on litter processing were equivocal. I argue, however, that the influence of terrestrial invertebrates on seasonal pond ecology has rarely been considered, and it might be significant in terms of overall ecosystem function.

AB The concentrations of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium accumulated by 12 emergent-rooted wetland plant species including different populations of Leersia hexandra, Juncus effusus and Equisetum ramosisti were investigated in field conditions of China. The results showed that metal accumulation by wetland plants differed among species, populations and tissues. Populations grown in substrata with elevated metals contained significantly higher metals in plants. Metals accumulated by wetland plants were mostly distributed in root tissues, suggesting that an exclusion strategy for metal tolerance widely exists in them. That some species/ populations could accumulate relatively high metal concentrations (far above the toxic concentration to plants) in their shoots indicates that internal detoxification metal tolerance mechanism(s) are also included. The factors affecting metal accumulation by wetland plants include metal concentrations, pH, and nutrient status in substrata. Mostly concentrations of Pb and Cu in both aboveground and underground tissues of the plants were significantly positively related to their total and/or DTPA-extractable fractions in substrata while negatively to soil N and P, respectively. The potential use of these wetland plants in phytoremediation is also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The abandoned mine of Shilbottle Colliery, Northumberland, UK is an example of acidic spoil heap discharge that contains elevated levels of many metals. Aerobic wetlands planted with the common reed, Phragmites australis, were constructed at the site to treat surface runoff from the spoil heap. The presence of a perched water table within the spoil heap resulted in the lower wetlands receiving acidic metal contaminated water from within the spoil heap while the upper wetland receives alkaline, uncontaminated surface runoff from the revegetated spoil. This unique situation enabled the comparison of metal uptake and growth of plants used in treatment schemes in two cognate wetlands. Results indicated a significant difference in plant growth between the two wetlands in terms of shoot height and seed production. Analyses of metal and nutrient concentrations within plant tissues provided the basis for three hypotheses to explain these differences: (i) the toxic effects of high levels of metals in shoot tissues, (ii) the inhibition of Ca (an essential nutrient) uptake by the presence of metals and H (+) ions, and (iii) low concentrations of bioavailable nitrogen sources resulting in nitrogen deficiency. This has important implications for the engineering of constructed wetlands in terms of the potential success of plant establishment and vegetation development. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eleocharis dulcis has proliferated in a constructed wetland used to treat uranium mine runoff water, where it rapidly accumulates significant quantities of uranium (U) in its roots and relatively little in its stems. We investigated the mechanism of U uptake and accumulation by E. dulcis using field-sampling techniques and microcosm test work. Results from the microcosm trials and outcomes from statistical tests of field sampled macrophyte, water and sediment indicate that the primary source of U for E. dulcis is the water column. Basipetal translocation of U to the plant's roots was indicated by significant correlations between the U content of stems, taproots and rhizomes and XPS detection of U inside root segments. U sequestering from sediment interstitial water by Fe hydroxides on root surfaces was also evident. No basipetal translocation was evident following the 28-day duration of the microcosm experiments, indicating that it is a longer-term process. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration determined using the energy-budget method at a semi-permanent prairie-pothole wetland in east-central North Dakota, USA was compared with 12 other commonly used methods. The Priestley-Taytor and deBruin-Keijman methods compared best with the energy-budget values; mean differences were less than 0.1 nm d(-1), and standard deviations were less than 0.3 mm d-1. Both methods require measurement of air temperature, net radiation, and heat storage in the wetland water. The Penman, Jensen-Haise, and Brutsaert-Stricker methods provided the next-best values for evapotranspiration relative to the energy-budget method. The mass-transfer, deBruin, and Stephens-Stewart methods provided the worst comparisons; the mass-transfer and deBruin comparisons with energy-budget values indicated a large standard deviation, and the deBruin and Stephens-Stewart comparisons indicated a large bias. The Jensen-Haise method proved to be cost effective, providing relatively accurate comparisons with the energy-budget method (mean difference = 0.44 mm d(-1), standard deviation = 0.42 mm d(-1)) and requiring only measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The Mather (Thornthwaite) method is the simplest, requiring only measurement of air temperature, and it provided values that compared relatively well with energy-budget values (mean difference = 0.47 mm d(-1), standard deviation = 0.56 mm d(-1)). Modifications were made to several of the methods to make them more suitable for use in prairie wetlands. The modified Makkink, Jensen-Haise, and Stephens-Stewart methods all provided results that were nearly as close to energy-budget values as were the Priestley-Taylor and deBruin-Keijman methods, and all three of these modified methods only require measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The modified Hamon method provided values that were within 20 percent of energy-budget values during 95 percent of the comparison periods, and it only requires measurement of air temperature. The mass-transfer coefficient, associated with the commonly used mass-transfer method, varied seasonally, with the largest values occurring during summer.

AB Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) often are affected to some degree by errors arising from limited fetch. A recently developed model was used to estimate fetch-induced errors in Bowen-ratio energy-budget measurements of ET made at a small wetland with fetch-to-height ratios ranging from 34 to 49. Estimated errors were small, averaging - 1.90% +/- 0.59%. The small errors are attributed primarily to the near-zero lower sensor height, and the negative bias reflects the greater Bowen ratios of the drier surrounding upland. Some of the variables and parameters affecting the error were not measured, but instead are estimated. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the uncertainty arising from these estimates is small. In general, fetch-induced error in measured wetland ET increases with decreasing fetch-to-height ratio, with increasing aridity and with increasing atmospheric stability over the wetland. Occurrence of standing water at a site is likely to increase the appropriate time step of data integration, for a given level of accuracy. Occurrence of extensive open water can increase accuracy or decrease the required fetch by allowing the lower sensor to be placed at the water surface. If fetch is highly variable and fetch-induced errors are significant, the variables affecting fetch (e.g., wind direction, water level) need to be measured. Fetch-induced error during the non-growing season may be greater or smaller than during the growing season, depending on how seasonal changes affect both the wetland and upland at a site.

AB Calcareous sloping fens are minerotrophic wetland systems that are well known for their high species richness, but little is known about the local processes that govern the spatial patterns of species distribution within these Communities. This study was undertaken to document vegetative patterns and to quantify community differences within one such calcareous wetland. A 250-m transect was established along a topographic/hydrologic gradient that intersected several visually distinctive, predominantly herbaceous, wetland plant communities. Vegetation composition was surveyed in July and August 1997 using a non-random, centralized sampling approach. Three 15-m(2) sampling plots were established for each of four stations along the transect. Vegetation within each 15-m(2) sampling plot was surveyed using fifteen contiguous 1-m(2) quadrat frames with visual estimates of cover determined for each species. One hundred thirty taxa were identified within the 180 m(2) area sampled. Average species richness values ranged from 61 to 76 species per 15-m(2) sampling plot, with high spatial turn-over of species among plots. Indicator Species Analysis identified taxa with concentrated abundance and fidelity within particular sampling stations. Data for the 15-m(2) plots were analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling that produced ordinations suggesting strong environmental gradients across the site. General community composition was similar to the Carex interior-C. leptalea-C. flava association described by Motzkin and consistent with other calcareous sloping fen communities described in the literature for the southern New England region.

AB Agriculture and urbanization in the upland landscape often generate stressors, such as sedimentation and eutrophication, that may negatively impact wetland plant communities. Individual plant species responses to stressors are also likely influenced by the hydrologic and geomorphologic characteristics of different wetland hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclasses. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent the two stressors listed above influence the growth and development of wetland plant species and how these responses vary across HGM subclasses. The impacts of the two stressors on wetland plant species emergence and growth were examined in a 2 X 2 factorial greenhouse experiment, using soil moisture and organic matter content to simulate three HGM subclasses. Both stressors elicited significant responses in species establishment and growth, but overall trends in stressor responses differed by wetland type. For instance, sedimentation reduced the emergence of four species in simulated riparian depressions but only affected one species in simulated slope wetlands and none in simulated headwater floodplains. Sedimentation had little impact on any species establishment or growth in headwater floodplains. Approximately half of the species showed an increase in at least one growth variable in response to nitrogen enrichment. Additionally, the conditions used to Simulate HGM subclasses appeared to impact a species performance and sensitivity to stressors. Therefore, further investigation of the impacts of HGM subclass conditions on species performance is needed. We expected differences in species responses to be related to their natural distribution across pristine and impacted wetlands; however, no obvious relationships were found. Our results suggest that it will be difficult to make generalizations about species responses to stressors because responses varied by stressor type, stressor interactions, and HGNI subclass. Therefore, perhaps the next step in formulating broad generalizations and predictions about wetland plant community composition will require a shift from species-based approaches to a trait-based approach for examining how species composition may change in response to future disturbances.

AB The goal of this study was to identify and characterize the range of variation in riparian forests across Lower Michigan, USA as a basis for assessing the utility of map-based information in the characterization of riparian environments. We obtained a regional sample of riparian forests and valley-bottom physiography from 94 locations throughout Lower Michigan and distinguished seven major riparian forest types using hierarchical clustering and NMDS ordination. NMDS ordination distances accounted for more than 70% of the distances in species space and achieved excellent discrimination among riparian types. We then evaluated a set of map-based variables indicative of regional climate, catchment hydrology, and valley character relative to ordination axes and interpretations of the autecology of principal tree species from each forest group. Map-based predictors accounted for 83% of the variation in sample scores along NMDS Axis 1 and explained 42% of the variation in Axis 2. Species and riparian types varied along two principal gradients, one associated with climate and geology along a north-south gradient, the second associated with flood duration and power. Map-based interpretations of regional climate and hydroperiod dynamics agreed closely with species-based interpretations of riparian character, although in certain cases, a similar biotic response arose from apparently distinct hydrogeomorphic contexts. Such dynamic patterns underscore the need for better and more explicit linkages between the controls of riparian hydrology and more proximal physical cues on biotic communities in order to understand the drivers of spatial variation in riparian ecosystem structure and composition.

ID SEED BANKS; DESIGN
AB Analogous to 'seed banks,' 'egg banks' are important for seasonal succession and maintenance of invertebrate species diversity throughout wet and dry cycles in the prairie pothole region. Further, recruitment of invertebrates from relic egg banks in the sediments and dispersal of eggs into wetlands is believed to be important for reestablishment of invertebrates in recently restored wetlands. Alhough tens-of-thousands of wetlands have been restored in the prairie pothole region of the United States, studies have not been conducted to evaluate the recovery of invertebrate egg banks in restored wetlands. We used taxon richness and abundance as indicators of potential egg bank recovery and compared these parameters in restored wetlands to those of non-drained and drained wetlands with a history of cultivation and also to reference wetlands with no history of cultivation. We found few significant differences among wetland categories within three physiographic regions (Glaciated Plains, Missouri Coteau, and Prairie Coteau). Most statistical comparisons indicated that restored wetlands had invertebrate egg banks similar to reference, non-drained, and drained wetlands. The one exception was drained seasonal wetlands in the Glaciated Plains, which had significantly lower taxon richness and invertebrate abundance than the other wetland categories. Trends did suggest that invertebrate egg bank taxon richness and abundance are increasing in restored seasonal wetlands relative to their drained analogues, whereas a similar trend was not observed for restored semi-permanent wetlands. Although recovery was not related to years since restoration, comparisons of restored wetlands with reference wetlands suggest that recovery potential may be inversely related to the extent of wetland drainage and intensive agriculture that varies spatially in the prairie pothole region. Our research suggests that periodic drawdowns of semi-permanent restored wetlands may be needed to promote production and development of invertebrate egg banks. Inoculation of restored wetlands may also be needed in areas where extensive wetland drainage has resulted in fewer wetland habitats to provide sources of passively dispersed eggs to newly restored wetlands.

AB Nutrient (e.g., phosphorus) retention is an important function of wetlands that can improve water quality. We examined soil physical and chemical characteristics and phosphorus (P) sorption capacities in three recently restored herbaceous wetlands (RWs) on previously cultivated soils and three adjacent natural forested wetlands (NWs) on Kent Island, Maryland, USA. Our objective was to compare P retention in these two wetland types. As hypothesized, NW soils differed fundamentally in soil chemistry and had significantly higher total organic carbon (TOC) contents than RW soils (5.7 +/- 1.7% vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1%, respectively, p < 0.05). A number of soil properties (bulk density, pH, labile organic and microbial P, total N, and total N: total P ratios) differed between natural and restored wetlands, as expected from the differences in TOC. Concentrations of pyrophosphate-extractable (organically-bound) Al (Al-p) were an order of magnitude larger in NW than in RW soils (2099.1 +/- 365.5 vs. 767.0 +/- 194.7 kg/ha, respectively). Although past studies have suggested that higher concentrations of organically-bound Al can enhance P sorption, P-sorption capacities were significantly greater in the RW soils, likely due to differences in soil chemistry. In the RWs, 15 soil chemical parameters were significantly correlated with P sorption (based on single factor regression), including residual Al, oxalate-extractable Al and Fe, clay, HCl-extractable Fe and pyrophosphate-extractable Fe (r(2) = 0.90, 0.89, 0.87, 0.85, 0.83 and 0.82, respectively). In contrast, P sorption in the NWs was correlated only with Al-p (r(2) = 0.68). As restored wetland soils are likely in transition from a non-hydric to a hydric state, they should be reevaluated periodically to determine the ultimate effects of this transition on their capacity to retain P.

AB This study describes the macrophyte assemblages of temporary floodplain wetlands situated on the floodplain of the Murray River, southeast Australia. Wetlands in the study are subject to flooding, the frequency, duration, and magnitude of which are dictated by the current, regulated river-flow regime. Our aim was to examine the influence of the existing flooding regime on macrophyte assemblages and to trial a monitoring program, based on a multiple before-after-control-impact (MBACI) design, to detect the impact of proposed environmental water allocations (EWAs) on the wetlands. Two categories of flooding regime were identified based on the flow magnitudes required for flooding to occur (flooding thresholds). In this scheme, wetlands with relatively low flooding thresholds are classed as 'impact' and those with higher thresholds are classed as 'control.' The wetlands were surveyed over a two-year period that incorporated at least one wetting-drying cycle at all wetlands. Results showed significant differences between survey times (season and year), but differences between flooding regime categories were significant only for some components of macrophyte assemblages. Differences between survey dates appear to reflect largely short-term responses to the most recent flood events. However, macrophyte differences observed between control and impact wetlands reflected the Cumulative effect of flood events over several years. Differences between control and impact wetlands were strongest for post-flooding surveys based on full assemblages (using ANOSIM) and among specific taxa and functional groups (using ANOVA). Power to detect differences between control and impact wetlands was greatest for species richness and total abundance, but taxa with low variability among wetlands, and hence good power, were actually less sensitive to hydrologic change. We conclude that the MBACI design used in this study will be most effective in detecting wetland ecosystem responses to the implementation of EWAs if response variables are carefully chosen based on their sensitivity to hydrologic change.

AB Bacteria should be excellent indicators of the early signs of degradation caused by human intervention because they have the highest surface area to volume ratio of all organisms. We determined the utility of a simple procedure that measures aerobic bacterial metabolic diversity (BIOLOG EcoPlates) as a reliable tool for assessing the effects of cattle grazing on spring ecosystems of the Bonneville Basin, Utah, USA. Marshes disturbed by cattle could be distinguished from protected marshes using EcoPlate analyses. The diversity of organic compounds used by bacteria was greater in grazed versus ungrazed marshes. A separate genetic analysis (DGGE) provided corroborating evidence. Greater metabolic diversity (EcoPlates) corresponded to greater bacterial assemblage diversity in grazed versus protected marshes. Greater plant diversity at grazed sites might account for the greater diversity of organic substrates used by bacteria in grazed sites. However, the results were not conclusive. In some marshes, a greater diversity of organic substrate use occurred where there was greater plant diversity, whereas in other marshes the diversity of organic substrates used by bacteria was lower where plant diversity was greatest. Regardless of the mechanism, aerobic bacterial metabolic diversity (EcoPlates) is a potentially valuable tool for assessing the early signs of degradation in wetland ecosystems.

AB The major objective of this research is to determine whether pollution trends could be reconstructed from sediment records at the downstream wetlands of the Huolin River. Sediment cores, representing a range of watershed characteristics and anthropogenic impacts, were collected from two marshes at the Xianghai Wetlands in order to trace the historical variation of heavy metals, accumulation rates, and chemical forms. Cores were Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated, and these data were used to calculate sedimentation rates and sediment accumulation rates that were compared with environmental change. Ranges of dry mass accumulation rates and sedimentation rates were 0.27-0.96g/cm(2)/yr and 0.27-0.90 cm/yr. After normalization to Al the anthropogenic enrichment of Cu, Zn, Cr, and Pb occurred in the upper layer of sediments and indicated that heavy metal contamination coming from the hydrologic inputs primarily occurred after the 1980s. This result was consistent with two decades of surface coal-mining history within the upstream region of Huolin River. Sediment inputs of most heavy metals at Xianghai Wetlands began to increase over background levels at around 1885 and were generally consistent with the time of the Qing Dynasty's immigration settlement. The anthropogenic inputs of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr, and Pb have been 1.20-3.67 times greater than values of their natural inputs after the 1980s, which may be a result of increased input of heavy metal-rich alluvial deposits derived from surface coal-mining activities in the watershed. Sequential extraction was used to describe partitioning of heavy metals among different mineralogical components in sediments, and results showed that heavy metals in sediment cores were mostly associated with the lithogenic bonding forms (residual fraction) and least with the exchangeable fraction (except Pb). The major fraction of Pb was in the Fe-Mn oxide fraction (mean: 40.7-48.6%), indicating that Pb in these sediments had greater mobility and suggested that it might be primarily from anthropogenic sources.

AB The delta of the Parana River in Argentina forms islands as it progrades into the Rio de la Plata estuary. In order to understand plant succession patterns, we analyzed cover-abundance and soil data along transects across topographic gradients of three islands. Using multivariate classification (TWINSPAN) and ordination (DCA and CCA), we developed a conceptual model of plant succession for these islands. The general pattern is that the bulrush, Schoenoplectus californicus, first colonizes bars and incipient islands that eventually accumulate sediments to become mature islands with levees dominated by the tree, Erythrina crista-galli, and interior emergent marshes at lower elevations also dominated by a bulrush, Scirpus giganteus. In contrast to earlier descriptions of a unique pathway of primary succession, we used elevation gradients, sediment composition, and inferred hydrologic regime to differentiate two major pathways of species colonization and persistence. During levee formation, colonization of high-energy environments by the bulrush leads to replacement by a mixture of forbs, and finally by a E. crista-galli forest. It is possible that further enrichment of the forest with other tree species is now obscured by Salicaceae plantations (Salix spp. and Populus spp.). Levee formation isolates the interior of islands hydrologically. There, nearly permanent flooding and lack of flushing allow dominance by S. giganteus. The persistence of this species is evidenced by its recovery after fire and its reestablishment after Salicaceae plantations are abandoned. It is noteworthy that two bulrush, S. californicus and S. giganteus, form the simplest stands in terms of richness and structure at highest and lowest energy environments, respectively. At any given site, species composition appears to respond to changes in topographic position, hydrologic regime, and sediment composition.

AB Wetlands are considered multi-functional ecosystems with important protection and use functions. However, before the 1980s, wetlands in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China were mainly reclaimed as paddy fields. In wetland restoration since 1998, there has been an urgent need to develop ecological industry substitutes that are economically efficient while having no negative effects on wetland ecology. Based on the research projects conducted in this region, five industry options were recommended, including 1) growing hydrophytes with high economic value, 2) raising livestock on the seasonal grasslands, 3) planting commercial seasonal vegetables, 4) developing aquaculture in the low-lying paddy fields, and 5) ecological tourism. Policies promoting these industries were aimed at solving problems concerning 1) input shortages and local farmers' unfamiliarity with required agricultural technologies and 2) integrated use of the regional ecological environment with wildlife protection.

AB Emergence traps were used to sample insects along a transect through a river delta wetland on Green Bay, Lake Michigan in an attempt to document spatial and temporal patterns in insect emergence. Various abiotic factors were also measured to determine which factors influenced these dynamics. Significant decreasing gradients in dissolved oxygen and pH with distance from the river, coupled with trends in sum nitrate (nitrate + nitrite), revealed that riverine water was mixing with wetland water up to 100 m from the wetland-river interface. Annual emerging insect densities decreased exponentially with distance from the river while emerging insect biomass decreased linearly with distance, both of which were significant. Insects were largely comprised of Chironomidae, which represented 7-88% of the insects emerging. Loss of biomass was largely due to emergence of Aeshnidae (0-34%), Libellulidae (0-69%), Coenagrionidae (0-23%), Siphlonuridae (0-63%), and Chironomidae (1-25%). Major Chironomidae emergence events occurred from early spring until early summer and again from late summer to early fall. These events were likely an important source of energy needed for avian egg production, duckling growth, or migratory flights. Spatial and temporal patterns revealed the importance of wetland areas adjacent to the Peshtigo River to emerging insects, as well as to the transient organisms that use them as a. food source.

AB Kushiro wetland in northeastern Japan is a Ramsar-designated wetland of international importance (1980) that is characterized by high biodiversity and spatial heterogeneity. These characteristics of the wetland also present innumerable challenges for mapping and monitoring such unique ecosystems. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided many sensors with different spatial and spectral scales and resolutions. However, they are still inadequate for mapping wetland vegetation at a large scale for various reasons, such as inadequate resolution and high costs. This study was designed to evaluate the potential of balloon aerial photography to acquire high resolution (15 cm pixel size) imagery for mapping wetland vegetation in the Akanuma marsh. We used a standard 28-mm non-metric camera (Nikon-F-801), which was mounted on helium-filled balloons operated by a remote radio-controlled system. By creating digital vegetation maps from visual interpretation of mosaicked photos, ten general types of vegetation and twenty-seven specific categories (species mixes) were successfully delineated. It was possible to classify small shrubs mixed with herbaceous plants; moss bogs with pools; dwarf shrubs with sedges; and moss with alpine plants. From this research, it seems that balloon aerial photography is a powerful tool for mapping temperate wetland vegetation, allowing classification of specific and typical vegetation types to the genus and species level.

AB Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is an invasive wetland perennial in North America native to Eurasia. Because light environment may limit the species' distribution, information on the relationship of forest canopy coverage to relative height and seed set in its native environment could give insight into its control in North America. This study examined the effect of various light environments related to forest canopy structure on seed set and stem height in L. salicaria in three biogeographical regions of Turkey spanning latitudes from 36 to 39degrees N. In Turkey, Lythrum salicaria grows in discrete patches in the canopy gaps of riverine forests, which often are dominated by Populus alba. The mean number of seeds per individual and stein height increased with decreasing canopy coverage (10437 +/- 284 to 20652 +/- 664 seeds individual(-1) and 116 +/- 2 to 173 +/- 2 cm, respectively). A number of insect seed herbivores were noted on these Turkish populations, most notably a seed predator (Nanophyes marmoratus), which destroyed all seeds in infested capsules. Our study suggested that the light characteristics associated with canopy gaps influenced the seed set and height of L. salicaria. Other factors likely played a role, such as insect herbivores, soil fertility, and competition with other species, which may also be affected by the light levels provided at various levels of canopy coverage.

AB A Pb-Zn tailings pond, abandoned for approximately 90 years, has been naturally colonized by Glyceria fluitans and is an excellent example of long-term metal retention in tailings ponds under various water cover and vegetation conditions. Shallow/ intermittently flooded areas (dry zone) were unvegetated and low in organic matter (OM) content. Permanently flooded areas were either unvegetated with low OM, contained dead vegetation and high OM, or living plants and high OM. It was expected that either water cover or high OM would result in enhanced reducing conditions and lower metal mobility, but live plants would increase metal mobility due to root radial oxygen loss. The flooded low OM tailings showed higher As and Fe mobility compared with dry low OM tailings. In the permanently flooded areas without live vegetation, the high OM content decreased Zn mobility and caused extremely high concentrations of acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). In areas with high OM, living plants significantly increased Zn mobility and decreased concentrations of AVS, indicating root induced sediment oxidation or decreased sulfate-reduction. This is the first study reporting the ability of wetland plants to affect the metal mobility and AVS in long-term (decades), unmanaged tailings ponds. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organotin compounds (OTC) are highly toxic pollutants and have been mostly investigated so far in aquatic systems and sediments. The concentrations and fluxes of different organotin compounds, including methyl-, butyl-, and octyltin species in precipitation and fog were investigated in a forested catchment in NE Bavaria, Germany. Contents, along with the vertical distribution and storages in two upland and two wetland soils were determined. During the 1-year monitoring, the OTC concentrations in bulk deposition, throughfall and fog ranged from I ng Sri l(-1) to several ten ng Sri l(-1), but never over 200 ng Sri l(-1). The OTC concentrations in fog were generally higher than in throughfall and bulk deposition. Mono-substituted species were the dominant Sn species in precipitation (up to 190 ng Sri l(-1)) equaling a flux of up to 70 mg So ha(-1) a(-1). In upland soils, OTC contents peaked in the forest floor (up to 30 ng Sri g(-1)) and decreased sharply with the depth. In wetland soils, OTC had slightly higher contents in the upper horizons. The dominance of mono-substituted species in precipitation is well reflected in the contents and storages of OTC in both upland and wetland soils. The ratios of OTC soil storages to the annual throughfall flux ranged from 20 to 600 years. These high ratios are probably due to high stability and low mobility of OTC in soils. No evidence was found for methylation of tin in the wetland soils. In comparison with sediments, concentrations and contents of organotin in forest soils are considerably lower, and the dominant species are less toxic. It is concluded that forested soils may act as sinks for OTC deposited from the atmosphere. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of land use on water quality in streams is scale-dependent and varies in time and space. In this study, land cover patterns and stocking rates were used as measures of agricultural development in two pasture and one native grassland catchment in New Zealand and were related to water quality in streams of various orders. The amount of pasture per subcatchment correlated well to total nitrogen and nitrate in one catchment and turbidity and total phosphorous in the other catchment. Stocking rates were only correlated to total phosphorous in one pasture catchment but showed stronger correlations to ammonium, total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the other pasture catchment. Winter and spring floods were significant sources of nutrients and faecal coliforms from one of the pasture catchments into a wetland complex. Nutrient and faecal coliform concentrations were better predicted by pastural land cover in fourth-order than in second-order streams. This suggests that upstream land use is more influential in larger streams, while local land use and other factors may be more important in smaller streams. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes need to be scale-sensitive. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Slope wetlands exist where topographic or stratigraphic conditions allow ground water to intersect the surface, creating a zone of perennial or near-perennial moisture. The condition and resiliency of slope wetlands are, therefore, controlled by their hydrodynamics (i.e., the movement and action of water in the wetland) and recharge mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms by which water flows into and through the wetland is essential for accurate assessment of potential indirect impacts and for the development of management measures geared toward preserving slope wetland functions. We investigated the physical and biological properties of twenty slope wetlands in southern California, USA to gain a better understanding of how their geologic setting influenced water movement through the wetlands and of the plant community composition in the wetland. Principle Components Analysis (PCA) separated the slope wetlands into three distinct groups based on geologic setting: those located in bedrock landslides, those associated with faults, and those associated with alluvial/colluvial deposits. Ground-water monitoring and hydrogeologic analysis showed that wetlands in alluvial/colluvial deposits respond quickly to precipitation, and subsurface water levels stay near the ground-surface elevation for extended periods of time. In contrast, subsurface water levels in bedrock landslide slope wetlands respond more slowly to precipitation, show greater variation over time, and ultimately decline more quickly after the cessation of recharge events. These observations (along with analysis of ground-water chemistry) indicate that wetlands in alluvial/colluvial deposits are likely supported by large, relatively stable volumes of ground water. In contrast, wetlands located in bedrock landslides are likely recharged from relatively localized ground-water sources with smaller storage volumes and greater interannual variability. Wetlands located along faults have an intermediate level of variation in moisture regime, indicating that their association with a fault may be providing a conduit for water delivery to the wetland. Plant species diversity did not differ between subclasses, although wetlands in alluvial/colluvial deposits supported slightly greater proportions of alkaline plant species. Understanding the different recharge characteristics of each subclass will allow for more informed decision-making regarding protection and management of slope wetlands.

AB Drainage, vegetation removal and harvesting, and vegetation restoration have a profound effect on carbon cycling in peatlands. Through laboratory incubations of 114 peat samples collected from the surface layer and just above and just below the water table at 13 sites, we examined the potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and methane (CH4) production under anaerobic conditions. CO2 production rates ranged from 0.04 to 1.05 mg g(-1) d(-1) under aerobic conditions and 0.01 to 0.29 mg g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. Rates of CO2 production were generally smallest in the lower parts of the profiles and at the recently restored sites where deep peat was exposed at the surface; they were largest in the freshly-formed surface peat at the undisturbed bog and older restoration sites where a strong cover of vegetation had developed. The CO2 production potentials were negatively correlated with the Von Post Index of decomposition, and aerobic: anaerobic production ratios averaged 4.3:1. Largest rates of anaerobic CH4 production occurred in samples close to the soil surface with fresh peat accumulation and a high water table, and smallest rates were in samples from the subsurface of sites with a low water table. Anaerobic CH4 production was significantly positively correlated with aerobic and anaerobic CO2 production. These production potentials show that drainage, harvesting, and restoration change the ability of the peat profile to produce and emit CO2 and CH4.

AB Despite visual similarities between marshes and moderate-rich fens in the southern part of the western boreal forest of Canada, there are ecological and functional differences between the two wetland classes. Western boreal marshes have received little attention and are often difficult to distinguish from moderate-rich fens in appearance, especially when both are located at the edges of ponds and small lakes. We examined species assemblages, net above-ground production, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and environmental characteristics in five wetlands, all with approximately I m of peat. Based on TWINSPAN and DCCA, both wetland classes contain Carex aquatilis, but marshes were characterized by Carex utriculata, Carex atherodes, Lemna minor, Typha latifolia, and no mosses. Fens were characterized by Carex lasiocarpa and various species of brown mosses, and overall, they were more variable in species composition. There were also functional differences between the classes, with net above-ground production (especially vascular plant production) greater in marshes. Decomposition rates were higher in marshes, with Carex mass losses of 86% compared to 73% in the fens after 506 days. Comparisons of our data with previous years also indicate that high water levels promote decomposition and suggest that differences in the decomposition rates between marshes and fens may ultimately be controlled by hydrologic conditions and not surface-water nutrient dynamics. Nutrient dynamics and concentrations differed between wetland classes. Concentrations of phosphorus were higher in marsh plants and lower in the peat soil than in fens. Nitrogen concentrations were higher in marsh peat than fen peat. Based on the N:P quotients of the dominant vegetation, plants in both wetlands were more limited by available N than P. Surface-water concentrations of all nutrients were higher in marshes than fens, although even the fens can be considered eutrophic, with total phosphor-us concentrations averaging approximately 100 mug L-1. Surface-water levels were generally higher in the marshes, and 90% of the variation in environmental variables between the two peatland classes could be explained by surface-water level, alkalinity, chloride, ammonium, and potassium. Thus, we found that marshes and moderate-rich fens have characteristic species assemblages and that these two wetland classes can be distinguished based on environmental variables and ecosystem functions, despite the strong visual similarities between some fens and marshes.

AB This project used three different experiments to test the hypothesis that deposition of small amounts of sediment in wetlands alters plant diversity and soil properties. Greenhouse experiments using potting soil and Sagittaria latifolia were used with 0.5-2 cm sediment treatments and controls. Thirty 2 m X 2 m plots were established in a freshwater palustrine marsh, and the plots were monitored before and after the addition of 1, 2, or 4 cm of sediment to half of the plots. Large vegetated cores of native soil were removed from the wetland and monitored in the greenhouse before and after the addition of 2 cm of sediment. Greenhouse experiments showed that less than 2 cm of sediment had no effects on the growth of S. latifolia, while 2 cm of sediment significantly increased aboveground biomass but had no effect on matrix potential or oxidation-reduction potential. Field plots showed significant differences in bulk density, organic matter, and phosphorus resulting from addition of sediment but did not show differences in water levels, temperature, plant diversity, biomass, or stem density under any amount of added sediment. Soil cores showed a significant difference in bulk density and in matrix potential near the soil surface under wetter conditions but showed no significant differences in temperature, evapotranspiration, oxidation-reduction potential, or aboveground biomass. The lack of effect seen in the field plots is likely the result of a low effective loading rate relative to the greenhouse experiments and the dense plant cover and thick debris layer of the wetland. Observed changes in bulk density would alter the hydrologic functions of the wetland if these depths of sediment occurred over a larger area. The tolerable level of sediment for a wetland depends on the structure and function of the individual wetland.

AB To assess attributes of algal assemblages as indicators of salt marsh restoration, we chose eight pairs of salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, each pair with one restored marsh (from I to 28 years old) and a nearby existing salt marsh. Algae on both Spartina alterniflora and sediments (sediment algae) were collected in each marsh during spring and summer 1998 for assaying algal biomass (dry mass (DM), ash free dry mass (AFDM), chl a content, algal biovolume), algal species composition and diversity, and gross primary production. An attribute restoration ratio was calculated by dividing attribute values from each restored marsh by values from a paired reference marsh. Controlling for regional variation in reference marshes substantially increased precision in relations between attributes and the increase in age of restored marshes. The organic matter restoration ratio of sediments increased with age of restored marshes in both spring and summer. The algal biomass restoration ratios of epiphytes, calculated with algal biovolume and chl a, increased with restored marsh age in summer but not during spring. Biomass of sediment algae was not related to marsh age. The species diversity of sediment algae in summer showed an asymptotic relationship with sediment nutrient concentration. The similarity of diatom species composition between paired restored and reference sites increased with age of restored marshes during spring and summer. Primary production by epiphytic and sediment algae in summer showed site-specific changes and did not change consistently with marsh age. Algal biomass, algal diversity, and diatom species composition during summer were positively correlated with sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. We concluded that other structural and functional development of restored wetlands, especially nutrient storage in sediments, regulates algal species composition and algal biomass accumulation, which can be used to evaluate salt marsh restoration.

AB We characterized the post-disturbance recruitment window for red maple (Acer rubrum) in a southern Appalachian wetland using size-class distributions and forest stand models. The DBH and core age of understory and overstory trees were measured in 108 plots in forested (closed) and unforested (open) fen and floodplain sites at the Tulula Creek wetland complex (a southern Appalachian wetland in Graham County, North Carolina) in 1994 and 2001 as part of a larger ecological study. In addition, the heights of red maple seedlings were measured in 379 quadrats in an unforested floodplain in 1996 and 2001. We examined the temporal patterning of wetland recruitment using red maple size-class data in order to determine (1) the recruitment window for seedling colonization and (2) temporal recruitment patterning based on the size/age structure of established tree stands. Diameter and height distributions were compared with power function, negative exponential and quadratic models in order to determine goodness of fit using the coefficient of determination (R-2). Diameter distributions and stand models showed that recruitment continued (at a diminishing rate) at sites that were last cleared 7, 14, and approximately 30 years earlier and ceased at a fourth site cleared approximately 45 years earlier. While there were minor recruitment fluctuations that possibly coincided with water-level changes, the unimodal size class distributions indicated that recruitment did not pulse subsequent to initial canopy disturbance. These results show that red maple readily colonized wetland habitats and that the recruitment window lasts at least twice as long as that reported in terrestrial systems. In addition, size-class distribution and regression analysis indicate that the colonization window is directly impacted by canopy disturbance and only indirectly influenced by water levels.

AB Approximately 7.3 hectares of wetlands, composed of six separate cells, were created to mitigate the loss of a 6-hectare, beaver-influenced, wetland-stream complex destroyed by the construction of a multipurpose impoundment in the Cedar Run watershed in Fauquier County, Virginia, USA. The mitigation action physically replaced the lost wetlands and was judged successful in meeting planned objectives and regulatory requirements (which did not include standards for biota). A pre-project fish survey conducted in 1974 in the wetland-stream complex and three nearby streams provided a baseline condition from which to assess project impacts on fish, as determined from yearly surveys in the cells and the stream reach immediately upstream. In addition, fish communities were sampled at 157 stream locations within the northern Virginia Piedmont from 1997 to 1999 to establish a regional Index of Biotic Integrity (1131) based on fish assemblages. A modification of that IBI was developed to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation based on 22 stream segments that were heavily influenced by beaver. Pre- and post-project conditions were assessed by gauging them against the wetland-stream complexes using this IBI. The IBI score for the mitigation area dropped from the pre-project 34 to 18 the first year after construction and ranged from 18 to 28 over the ten-year post-project monitoring period. A reduction in the number of native species was observed, and there was a dramatic shift in composition and relative abundance within key species groups. In general, the mitigation benefited species favoring lentic environments over those preferring lotic environments and had negative effects on trophic and habitat specialists and less tolerant species. Scores for the mitigation cells were lower than scores for the original wetlands for the following IBI metrics: number of darter species, number of minnow species, percent of the assemblage comprised of the single most dominant species, percent of tolerant individuals, percent of benthic invertivores, and percent of specialist carnivores minus tolerants. Upstream reach IBI scores also diminished over the same 10-year period, although more gradually. The IBI showed that, despite meeting all regulatory requirements, the mitigation failed to replace the original fish community in the wetland-stream complex and adversely impacted additional stream habitat. Using tools such as an IBI to monitor biological condition can help planners effectively mitigate unavoidable project impacts and avoid the unintended loss of important natural resources caused by compensatory mitigation actions.

AB Orchid Meadows is a long-term wetland research and monitoring site on the Coteau des Prairie in extreme east-central South Dakota, USA. It is a 65-ha Waterfowl Production Area with numerous temporary, seasonal, and semi-permanent wetlands. Ground water and surface water have been monitored at the site from 1987 to 1989 and from 1993 to the present. Vegetation has been monitored since 1993. The monitoring record includes two nearly back-to-back weather extremes: a drought in the late 1980s and a deluge in the early- to mid-1990s. Wetlands differed sharply in water levels between 3-yr dry and wet periods. For example, the time of inundation ranged among semi-permanent wetlands from 13 to 71 percent during the dry years to 100 percent during the wet years, while for seasonal wetlands, it was 0-29 percent and 46-100 percent, respectively, during dry and wet periods. Temporary wetlands had no surface water during the dry period but had standing water 0-67 percent of the time during the deluge years. The highest ground-water levels during the dry period were lower than most levels during the wet period. The difference in the water-table elevations of temporary wetlands between the periods was as much as 4 m. Ground-water levels near semi-permanent wetlands were considerably more stable (annual range of 0.3-1.6 m) than those near temporary wetlands (1.3-2.5 m). The results support the concept that weather extremes drive the wetland cover cycle and other key ecological processes in prairie wetlands. The new data from Orchid Meadows, together with other long-term data sets from North Dakota and Saskatchewan, Canada, are useful for many research purposes, including the parameterization and testing of models that simulate the effects of climate variability and climate change on prairie wetland ecosystems.

AB Previous research has demonstrated that beavers (Castor canadensis) dramatically alter fish habitat in streams by their dam-building activities. Although less well-known, beavers also flood closed peatlands by damming seepage rather than streamflow. Our study focuses on the establishment of fish communities in isolated beaver ponds created in small, ombrogenous peatlands lacking any open water prior to beaver occupation. We selected 16 ponds that ranged in age from 4 to 42 years and three unaltered peatlands to determine whether beaver promote the use of peatlands by fish and if the patterns of individual species were related to macrophyte density. Fish were present in ponds as young as four years old, and five of the six species of fish were present in ponds less than or equal to 16 years old. Submersed macrophyte abundance explained 40% of the variation in fish diversity. Rapid colonization of fish in beaver-altered peatlands provides further evidence of how beavers increase the complexity of biological food webs in boreal regions. Moreover, this work provides an even greater understanding of the historical role of beavers as ecosystem engineers in peatland dominated landscapes.

AB The objectives of this paper are to summarize existing knowledge on the hydrologic characteristics of tidal marshes in the New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ) Estuary, to document the extensive linkages between hydrology and tidal marsh function, to underline their importance in designing restoration projects, and to identify research needs in this area. Hydrologic processes are responsible for the evolution, inter- and intra- marsh variability, and functional value of tidal marshes. Hydrology also controls the movement of materials and organisms between estuaries, wetlands, uplands, and the atmosphere. The importance of hydrology to tidal marsh function is widely recognized by the scientific community. Hydrologic research in tidal wetlands of the NY/NJ Estuary, however, is lacking. Anthropogenic development activities have resulted in drastic losses of tidal wetland value, and restoration is now finally a priority in many of the region's natural resource management plans. The success of tidal marsh restoration efforts depends on how appropriately hydrologic factors and their interdependencies are recognized and incorporated into design; yet, little guidance about how best to restore tidal marsh hydrology is available. There is a need to document better the hydrologic characteristics of existing and historical tidal wetlands, to improve hydrologic modeling capabilities, and to accompany other ecological investigations in tidal marshes with hydrologic documentation.

AB Seedling establishment is an important means of re-colonizing herbicide-treated and burned Phragmites australis marshes and of filling in newly created or naturally forming marshes. Knowing the differential sensitivity of the various species to sulfide better enables us to predict which plants are likely to colonize given areas (i.e., be it desirable species or P. australis). This study focuses on the sulfide sensitivity of the seedlings of five plant species that may re-colonize the cleared marsh surface either from wild seed stock or introduced propagules: Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, Setaria magna, Atriplex triangularis, and P. australis. Seedlings were grown in culture tubes in semi-solid agar media containing Hoagland's nutrients; sulfide treatments included levels of sulfide from 0 to 8 mM. Parameters measured included number of leaves, number of lateral roots, shoot length, root length, leaf length, and biomass. Setaria magna proved to be the most sensitive to sulfide, followed in order by A. triangularis, S. patens, P. australis, and S. alterniflora. Differences in edaphic sulfide are not likely to be helpful in favoring S. magna, A. triangularis, or S. patens over P. australis. Phragmites australis was compared to S. alterniflora in a second experiment with six concentrations of sulfide between 0 and 2.0 mM. Results indicated that sulfide levels between 0.4 and 0.9 mM would favor seedling establishment of S. alterniflora over P. australis, and at 0.9 mM, S. alterniflora seedlings would have the decided advantage.

AB Salt marsh restoration practices based on the reintroduction of tides to hydrologically-altered wetlands may be hindered by a lack of specific knowledge regarding plant community response to environmental change. Since saltmarsh plant communities are controlled by physical stress tolerance and competition, we conducted a field experiment that measured effects of saltwater flooding and competitive interactions on plants as a guide for predicting habitat response to tidal restoration. Six plant species of New England salt marshes were studied: halophytes Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, and Juncus gerardii and brackish invasive species Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, and Lythrum salicaria. Plant shoots were transplanted across a gradient of three flooding and three salinity regimes and arranged into pair-wise competitive combinations. After one growing season, saltwater flooding was found to decrease transplant survival, biomass production, and/or relative growth for all species. Reduction in halophyte growth was largely due to increased flood duration; brackish species were most reduced by increased salinity. Interspecific competition also influenced species growth, although the short duration of the study may have weakened these effects. Transplants paired with S. alterniflora had reduced growth, but combinations with Juncus produced increased growth. Standardized factors of stress tolerance and relative competitive strength were derived for the six study species as a framework for understanding community-level changes in marshes. As an aid to resource managers, experimental results can be used to predict plant community response to existing and potential alterations in saltmarsh tidal hydrology.

AB We describe a conceptual model, the wetland continuum, which allows wetland managers, scientists, and ecologists to consider simultaneously the influence of climate and hydrologic setting on wetland biological communities. Although multidimensional, the wetland continuum is most easily represented as a two-dimensional gradient, with ground water and atmospheric water constituting the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. By locating the position of a wetland on both axes of the continuum, the potential biological expression of the wetland can be predicted at any point in time. The model provides a framework useful in the organization and interpretation of biological data from wetlands by incorporating the dynamic changes these systems undergo as a result of normal climatic variation rather than placing them into static categories common to many wetland classification systems. While we developed this model from the literature available for depressional wetlands in the prairie pothole region of North America, we believe the concept has application to wetlands in many other geographic locations.

AB As in most large capital cities, urban stormwater discharging into Port Jackson (Sydney) is highly enriched in a wide range of contaminants, which has resulted in degradation of the receiving basin waters and bottom sediments. The objective of the current investigation was to determine the removal efficiency of contaminants in urban stormwater by a wetland constructed in the Sydney catchment. The wetland (700 m(2)) drains a residential urban catchment of about 480,000 m(2) comprising predominantly houses, streets, gardens, and street parking areas. Samples of stormwater influent and effluent were obtained during rainfall events between April and June 2000. Eight samples were collected at the inlet and outlet to the wetland during each event and analyzed for nutrients, trace metals, total suspended solids (TSS), and organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Water quality parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, conductivity) were measured concurrently. The average removal efficiency of trace metals Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn was 64%, 65%, 65%, 22%, and 52%, respectively for the six events measured, whereas for Fe and Mn, removal efficiencies were negative for most events (mean-84% and-294%, respectively). The average removal efficiency of NO, and TN was 22% and 16%, respectively. The average removal efficiencies of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 9% and 12%, respectively. During four high-flow events, the removal efficiency of TSS in stormwater effluent from the wetland was between 9% and 46%; however, substantially higher TSS concentrations were observed in effluent than influent waters during two very high-flow events (removal efficiency-98% and -67%). Fecal coliform counts in the stormwater in this catchment are high (maximum: 620,000 cfu/100 ml), but mean removal efficiency was 76% (range 26% to 98%) during the four high-flow events monitored. Nevertheless, most samples from the outflow exceeded the Public Health criterion for secondary contact (e.g., boating) of 1000 cfu/100 ml. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PAHs in stormwater were below analytical detection. Although highly variable, lower concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, NOx, TN, and fecal coliform in the stormwater effluent compared to influent waters indicates that the wetland was moderately efficient in removing contaminants from urban stormwater.

AB Seasonal riparian seedbed temperatures were measured and germination of Carex utriculata and C nebrascensis seeds was tested in relation to chilling, perigynia removal, incubation temperature, and light to help guide propagation and direct seeding of these species for riparian restoration. Diurnal temperatures of riparian seedbeds at two sites in Strawberry Valley, Utah, USA ranged from 3.1 to 11.2degrees C in May to 9.5 to 24.1degrees C in August when water was generally available for seed germination. Pre-incubation treatments of chilling at 5degrees C for 7 to 150 days and perigynia removal increased germination of 2-year-old seeds of these species but were not necessary for high germination percentages (>89%) when seeds were incubated in light under a summer temperature regime (10 to 24degrees C). Seeds aged 0.5 and 1.5 years had lower germination percentages than 2-year-old seed but also had adequate germination percentages (> 20%) for greenhouse propagation without pre-treatments when incubated in light at the summer temperature regime. After 5.5 years of storage at room temperatures, germination of C. utriculata was negligible, but that of C nebrascensis was >35%. Seeds of both species that were overwintered in seed bags in riparian microsites had high germination percentages (>80%) when retrieved the following summer and incubated at a summer temperature regime in light. Although direct seeding in fall would allow natural chilling and potentially high germination percentages the following spring or summer, the risk of seed loss or excessive burial is great during high spring stream flows. A better strategy is to surface-seed wet seedbeds in early summer after peak flows have receded and temperature and light conditions are conducive to high germination percentages.

AB Previous research on habitat associations of pond-breeding amphibians has used community assemblages as response variables because the intensive labor required to quantify population size is usually prohibitive. However, wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) oviposit egg masses that can be surveyed rapidly; thus, we were able to quantify the influence of within-pond parameters on their annual breeding effort. During 2000-2001, we assessed the effects of hydroperiod, within-pond vegetation, canopy closure, hydrologic isolation, fish occurrence, and pond size on egg mass counts of wood frogs and spotted salamanders at 124 ponds in western Rhode Island. Study sites were stratified by road density, which served as an indirect measure of non-breeding habitat quality and quantity. Hydroperiod had a significant influence on annual breeding effort. Egg masses of both species were most abundant in seasonal ponds that dried between I August and 30 November. Breeding populations of spotted salamanders were smaller in ponds that dried before the end of July, whereas breeding populations of wood frogs were reduced in ponds that did not dry during our two-year study. Both species usually attached egg masses to shrubs or branches in shallow water near the water surface, which may explain why both species oviposited more egg masses in ponds with substantial vegetation complexity, including extensive coverage by shrubs and persistent non-woody vegetation. Although wood frogs were more likely than spotted salamanders to avoid ovipositing in ponds with fish, egg mass counts of both species were substantially reduced in ponds containing fish. Numbers of egg masses for spotted salamanders and wood frogs were similar between larger ponds and those as small as 0.05 ha and 0.15 ha, respectively. Previously, researchers proposed protecting isolated wetlands > 0.2 ha to sustain populations of pond-breeding amphibians, but our research suggests that wetlands as small as 0.05 ha may provide critical breeding habitat for some species in southern New England.

AB The relationship between environmental factors and the spatial distribution of maintained and actively used burrows of the grapsid crab Helograpsus haswellianus was studied at three saltmarsh sites in southeast Queensland, Australia. The sites had been modified by tunnelling for mosquito-control, a method that transports low-amplitude tides to areas of saltmarsh. The study investigated the relationship between burrow density, burrow aperture size, and runnelling, as well as the effect of flooding or non-flooding tides and distance from a tidal source. Responses differed at the three sites. The most consistent pattern across all sites was that active burrows were most numerous between 30 and 50 m from the saltmarsh / mangrove interface at the landward side of the tidal source. At particular sites, there were significant relationships between burrow aperture size, tidal period, and the presence of runnels. Generally, few small burrows occurred low on the shore, while larger burrows were distributed across the shore to 50 m. At naturally dry sites, more burrows occurred within 5 m of the runnel, whereas at naturally wet sites, fewer burrows were found close to the runnel. As runnels transport low-amplitude tides, moisture conditions required for burrowing may very between flooding and non-flooding tides. Overall, the influence of tides on the density of crab burrows and their aperture sizes was of more importance than the presence of runnels alone.

AB Reference wetlands play an important role in efforts to protect wetlands and assess wetland condition. Because wetland vegetation integrates the influence of many ecological factors, a useful reference system would identify natural vegetation types and include models relating vegetation to important regional geomorphic, hydrologic, and geochemical properties. Across the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain, depression wetlands are a major hydrogeomorphic class with diverse characteristics. For 57 functional depression wetlands in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, we characterized the principal vegetation types and used a landscape framework to assess how local (wetland-level) factors and regional landscape settings potentially influence vegetation composition and dynamics. Wetland sites were stratified across three Upper Coastal Plain landscape settings that differ in soils, surface geology, topography, and land use. We sampled plant composition, measured relevant local variables, and analyzed historical transitions in vegetative cover types. Cluster analysis identified six vegetation types, ranging from open-water ponds and emergent marshes to closed forests. Significant vegetation-environment relationships suggested environmental "templates" for plant community development. Of all local factors examined, wetland hydrologic regime was most strongly correlated with vegetation type, but depression size, soil textural type, and disturbance history were also significant. Because hydrogeologic settings influence wetland features, local factors important to vegetation were partly predictable from landscape setting, and thus wetland types were distributed non-randomly across landscape settings. Analysis of long-term vegetation change indicated relative stability in some wetlands and succession in others. We developed a landscape-contingent model for vegetation dynamics, with hydroperiod and fire as major driving variables. The wetland classification, environmental templates, and dynamics model provide a reference framework to guide conservation priorities and suggest possible outcomes of restoration or management.

AB It is well documented that Louisiana is experiencing wetland loss at rates greater than any other locale in the world. High rates of relative sea-level rise, a combination of eustatic sea-level rise and subsidence, is anticipated to compound this problem further in the future through increased flooding and encroachment of saline water into freshwater wetlands. The research presented in this paper examines the interactive effect of increased salinity level, flooding depth, and soil type on the growth responses of a dominant Louisiana fresh-water marsh plant, Panicum hemitomon, whose prevalence in Louisiana is currently in decline. This study was conducted under greenhouse conditions and employed a factorial design consisting of three salinity-levels (0, 1.5, 3.0 ppt), three hydrologic regimes (0, 10, 20 cm), and two soil types (high organic content, low organic content). Panicum hemitomon productivity was significantly reduced even under the relatively small increases in salinity level (1.5 and 3.0 ppt) imposed in this study. Interestingly, moderate flooding tended to increase productivity, although this relationship was not statistically significant. Significantly greater productivity was observed for plants grown in mineral soil compared with organic soil. These results indicate that any degree of saline influx into P. hemitomon-dominated wetlands will result in decreased vigor and localized decline of this species. Moderate increases in the degree of freshwater inundation may not be as damaging as originally expected and, in fact, may actually stimulate production. However, if increased flooding is accompanied by increased salinity levels, which is anticipated to occur, then the overall effect on this species will be detrimental.

AB Recovery of wetland function is the primary goal of wetland creation. This study was undertaken to quantify denitrification and soil characteristics of wetlands created after lignite mine reclamation in east Texas, USA. Surface-soil denitrification rate and capacity were quantified using an acetylene (C,H,) inhibition/gas chromatography method in created wetlands of two age classes (4-8 years, and 10 years) on two mine soil types. Soil texture, pH, total-N, ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), cation exchange capacity (CEC), total-P, and organic matter (OM) content were determined. Soil characteristics varied by soil type and by age. Denitrification rate ranged from less than I to 105 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), was highly variable, but did not differ among created wetlands. Denitrification rate was similar between natural and created wetlands. Denitrification capacity, denitrification rate when nitrate is in excess, ranged from 23 to 302 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) and varied by soil type. Denitrification appears to function as well in wetlands created on mine soil as in natural wetlands, but may be limited by soil characteristics.

AB This study determined lethal dose levels of road salt on selected macroinvertebrates from a Michigan, USA wetland under different testing conditions and related those levels to in situ chloride concentrations of standing water habitats along multi-lane highways. We conducted simultaneous acute (24 and 96 h) and chronic (15 d) toxicity experiments using laboratory containers, containers adjacent to a wetland, and in situ modular field PVC microcosms. Data showed that Callibaetis fluctuans, Physella integra, Hyallela azteca, and Chaoborus americanus had relatively high tolerance to elevated road-salt levels. Depending on test condition, road-salt 96 h LC50 estimates ranged from greater than 5000 mg l(-1) (2558 mg l(-1) Cl-) to >10,000 mg l(-1) (4502 mg l(-1) Cl-) road salt for C. fluctuans and P. integra, respectively. For H. azteca and C americanus, mortality was generally low at all salt concentrations, with road-salt 96 h LC50 estimates >10,000 mg l(-1). Chloride concentrations of 43 impacted Michigan wetlands ranged from 18 to 2700 mg l(-1) Cl-1, with 75% <334 mg l(-1), indicating that macroinvertebrate LC50 chloride estimates for the study species are well above most concentrations of the 43 wetlands.

AB Wetland habitats continue to be lost at a unsettling rate, especially freshwater emergent wetlands that are isolated geographically. These are the predominant wetlands found in and and semi-arid environments, where they serve as foci of regional biodiversity. This is especially true of the playa wetlands of the Southern High Plains of Texas, USA. The factors that determine and maintain biotic diversity in these wetlands are understood poorly. Consequently, this study examined the effect of island biogeographic and landscape features on the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands. Macroinvertebrates were collected from playas three times during the spring and summer of 1994 and categorized as resident or transient taxa based on life history strategies. Diversity was estimated using taxonomic richness (richness) and Fisher's log-series alpha (a). Surrounding land-use, practices influenced resident richness, whereas playa surface area affected resident and transient richness, as well as resident alpha. However, relationships differed among sampling dates. Regression analyses suggested that transient richness and alpha were influenced more by insular characteristics than by landscape features. The converse was true for resident richness and alpha.. Therefore, both insular and landscape characteristics affected the diversity of macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands, but impacts were dependent on life-history strategy and time since inundation (i.e., sampling date). Consequently, conservation and management efforts targeting macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands will need to focus on the wetlands and characteristics of adjacent watershed features.

AB This study presents measurements and modeled estimates of fall water requirements for the seasonal wetlands under moist soil management at Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge in northern California, USA. For three representative seasonal wetlands on the refuge, we measured the total volume of water required to fill the units and partitioned this volume into three components: surface water volume, ET losses, and soil-saturation requirements. Flood-up of seasonal wetlands required an average inflow rate of 0.87 ha-m/ha, with a range from 0.55 to 1.08 ha-m/ha. Over half of this water goes to saturate the underlying soils. We present a model for determining the approximate fall water requirement of any seasonal wetland on the refuge, given information on the effective porosity, depth to groundwater, average precipitation and ET, and the volumetric capacity of the wetland. Using a combination of measurements and modeled or assumed rates, we estimated the total fall water requirements for the refuge for 1999, 2000, and 2001. The estimates compared favorably with measured fall water deliveries to the refuge for the three years. Lastly, we compared annual water requirements for seasonally flooded and permanently flooded wetlands at Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge. Water requirements for the two wetland habitat types are approximately equal, although there are differences in the timing of demand and the consumptive use. Permanently flooded wetlands require water throughout the season to satisfy evapotranspiration needs, and none of this water is returned to the system. Seasonally flooded wetlands require water only in the fall during flood-up, and much of this water is returned to the system in the spring.

AB Woodland vernal pools occur commonly throughout northeastern North America. These pools provide preferred breeding habitat for mole salamanders (Ambystoma spp.) and wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and support an abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate fauna. Vernal pool hydrology, and especially hydroperiod or duration of the wet phase, affects the composition and productivity of pool fauna. The hydrology of ephemeral wetlands is dominated by local weather conditions. In this paper, I report a ten-year record of the relationships between precipitation and evapotranspiration and water-level change and hydroperiod in four typical southern New England vernal pools. Long-term average precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year in the Northeast; potential evapotranspiration peaks in the summer months and exceeds precipitation from mid-June through mid-September. This period of water deficit causes the period of maximum vernal pool drying. Vernal pool hydroperiods were shorter and pools dried earlier in those years with larger cumulative water deficits, especially when early spring ground-water resources were below long-term means and late winter snowpack was reduced or absent. Weekly water-level change in vernal pools was significantly related to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, with precipitation having 2-5 times greater effect than evapotranspiration. Under climate-change predictions of more episodic precipitation and increased evapotranspiration, vernal pools would dry earlier in the year and remain dry longer. These changes would adversely affect the successful reproduction of pool-breeding amphibians and isolate the remaining productive pools.

AB A chronosequence of restiad peat bogs (dominated by Restionaceae) in the lowland warm temperate zone of the Waikato region, North Island, New Zealand, was sampled to identify the major environmental determinants of vegetation pattern and dynamics. Agglomerative hierarchical classification of vegetation data from 69 plots in nine different-aged bogs, initiated from c. 600 to c. 15,000 cal yr BP, identified eight groups. Six of these groups formed a sequence from sedges through Empodisma minus, the main peat-forming restiad species, to phases dominated by a second restiad species, Sporadanthus ferrugineus. The sequence reflected bog age and paralleled patterns of temporal succession over the last 15,000 years (from early successional sedges through mid-successional Empodisma to late successional Sporadanthus) derived from previous studies of plant macrofossils and microfossils in peat cores. This indicated that different-aged bogs in the Waikato region could be used to interpret temporal succession. The remaining two classificatory groups comprised plots from sites modified by drainage, fire, or weed invasion and currently dominated by non-restiad species. The relationships between environmental variables and the six groups representing restiad bog succession indicated that, as succession proceeds, von Post decomposition index and nutrients in the top 7.5 cm peat zone decrease. The most useful indicators of successional stage were von Post, total P, total N, and % ash. Environmental response curves of the dominant plant species separated the species along nutrient and peat decompositional gradients, with early successional species having wider potential environmental ranges than late successional species. Empodisma minus, a mid-successional species, also had a relatively wide environmental range, which probably contributes to its key role in restiad bog development.

AB The relation between the occurrence of riverine wetlands in floodplains along a humid to semi and climatic continuum was studied in two regions. The first included 36 mid-reach streams from Colorado to Iowa, USA, a region with a broad range of PET ratios (potential evapotranspiration/precipitation) from 0.70 to 1.75. The second region included 16 headwater streams in eastern North Carolina with PET ratios ranging from 0.67 to 0.83. Wetland boundaries were identified in the field along transects perpendicular to the floodplain. The width of jurisdictional wetlands was compared with flood-prone width (FPW) and expressed as a percent. An increase in PET ratio corresponded to an exponential decrease in the percentage of the FPW that is wetland. Soil texture, duration of overbank flow, and stream order did not correlate with percentage of FPW that was wetland. Streams with a PET ratio greater than 0.98 did not have wetlands associated with them. Greater channel cross-sectional areas correlated positively with greater wetland widths in both study regions. Overbank flow did not appear to contribute to wetland prevalence. Supplemental ground-water sources, however, as indicated by greater base flows, could not be ruled out as sources contributing to wetland occurrence.

AB In northern peatlands with water tables at or near the surface, the Sphagnum moss layer is potentially the only aerobic region where CH, oxidation can occur. We hypothesized that mosses with varying physiologies would create different conditions for methane-oxidizing bacteria and, in turn, affect rates of CH, consumption. We measured in-vitro CH, consumption potential of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum capillifoliun taken from the same habitat and S. magellanicum and Sphagnum majus across habitats to compare and contrast species and environmental effects. In certain cases, S. capillifolium consumed CH, more rapidly than S. magellanicum taken from identical habitats, although the greatest difference in consumption rates between species was only 29 mug CH, g(-1) dry moss d(-1), compared to a maximum difference of 126 and 415 mug CH, g(-1) dry moss d(-1) in S. magellanicum and S. majus sampled from different habitats. In most cases, CH, was consumed most rapidly in the lower, non-photosynthetic portions of the Sphagnum mosses, and consumption potential increased with an increase in the concentration of CH, in the habitat. We hypothesize that CH, consumption occurred internally, likely in the hyaline cells, as external surface sterilization did not significantly alter CH, consumption rates. This work provides evidence that different Sphagnum moss species have variable ability to oxidize CH,, although inter-species differences are small compared to differences across habitats.

TI pH and nutrient effects on above-ground net primary production in a

AB Nutrient limitation is often assumed to be similar among the species of a plant community. However, limitation can differ among ecosystems and among life forms and individual species within a particular ecosystem. Peatlands have some of the lowest nutrient availabilities and highest acidities among wetland types, but the relative roles of nutrient limitation and pH stress in structuring peatland plant communities are unknown. Accordingly, we measured changes in above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and percent cover of plants to additions of low levels of N, P, and calcium carbonate in a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA. Plots were treated for three years with a combination of 2 or 6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) as ammonium, 0.67 or 2 g P m(-2) yr(-1), and/or calcium carbonate to raise the pH of the bog from 3.8 to 4.9 and the pH of the fen from 4.9 to 6.4. In the bog, the low N treatment increased ANPP, whereas the high N treatment inhibited ANPP. Lime addition also stimulated ANPP. The whole-community bog response was largely due to bryophytes, which accounted for 76% of ANPP on average. However, the productivity of the shrub community (18% of total ANPP) increased with P additions but only during the third year of fertilizer application. Productivity of the bog graminoids did not respond significantly to any addition. Fen ANPP was stimulated by P addition, but the effect was isolated to graminoids (95% of total ANPP), and this was largely due to the response of Carex exilis. Our results suggest that low nutrient availability does not necessarily imply nutrient limitation of peatland plant communities. Furthermore, life forms and individual species responded differently, indicating that there are several levels of nutrient limitation within each peatland community. In particular, bog Sphagnum mosses appear to have a very low tolerance for N. Production and community structure were controlled by N-availability and pH in the bog and by P-availability in the fen.

ID ACID ESTERS; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; WATER; GAC
AB Two sets of small scale systems of staged, vertical-flow constructed wetlands (VFCW) were operated in a greenhouse to study the purification of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in admeasured water. Each system consisted of two chambers in which water flowed downward in chamber I and then upward in chamber 2. The systems were intermittently fed with wastewater under a hydraulic load of 420 mm(.)d(-1). The measured influent concentrations of DBP in the experimental system were 9.84 mg(.)l(-1), while the other system was used as a control and received no DBP. Effluent concentrations of the treated system averaged 5.82 mug(.)l(-1) and were far below the Chinese DBP discharge standard of less than or equal to0.2 mg(.)l(-1). These results indicate the potential purification capacity of this new kind of constructed wetland in removing DBP from a polluted water body.

AB The benthic invertebrates of three adjacent wetlands in northeastern Ohio, USA were sampled with a benthic corer during May-August 2001. The three wetlands consisted of a deep created wetland that overflowed into a shallow created wetland and a pre-existing natural wetland. The created wetlands were four years old and seeded with cattails. Forty-two invertebrate taxa were collected from all wetlands combined, and 11 taxa were abundant (represented >1% of total). Taxa richness, evenness, and community similarity were comparable among the three wetlands. Seed shrimp (Ostracoda), midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), copepods (Copepoda), fingernail clams (Bivalvia: Sphaeriidae), and water fleas (Cladocera) were the five most abundant taxa (38%, 13%, 11%, 9%, and 8%, respectively). Clams were significantly more abundant in the natural wetland, whereas no significant difference in density of other invertebrates was detected among wetlands. Laboratory inundations of soil taken from the rapidly drying basins of the natural and shallow created wetlands produced 10 taxa that survived the dry periods with desiccation-resistant stages and were dominated by microcrustaceans, Aedes mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), clams, and annelid worms. Our data indicate that the created wetlands developed benthic invertebrate communities that were similar to the adjacent natural wetlands in a short period of time (four years), but clams were slow to colonize the human-made habitats.

TI A practical approach to monitoring water levels in prairie wetlands

AB Water-level monitoring was initiated on several wetland complexes on the Canadian Prairies in the early 1960s. Many of these wetland complexes are still actively being monitored using a method that obtains point measurements of water depth that can be used to determine water-level changes over time. This paper describes the depth-gauging method used in obtaining long-term water-level data for wetlands on the Canadian Prairies. This method has proven to be very reliable provided that observers are diligent about following procedural guidelines. Point measurements of relative depth resulted in stage values within 25 mm of those measured using conventional level surveys. In wetlands where more than one monitoring marker is deployed to monitor the range of water levels, a conversion factor is often used to determine maximum depth. The accuracy in determining maximum depth with a conversion factor is considered to be within 50 mm. Experience has demonstrated that the reliability of this method is dependent on the consistency of data collection, vigilance in the field, and careful screening of the data. Maintaining horizontal position of the measurement location is important, as the lowest point in the wetland is used as a relative datum. Vertical movements of the monitoring marker can also result in errors in the data if not identified and corrected accordingly.

AB A pilot-scale constructed wetland (CW) system, combining a free water surface wetland and a subsurface wetland in series, was used to purify highly polluted river water. The concentrations of constituents varied seasonally. The effects of season-dependent parameters, such as temperature, mass loading rate and inflow salinity, on the removal of ammonia nitrogen (AN) in the wetland system were examined at a constant hydraulic loading rate, based on data from June 1998 to February 2000. AN removal of the CW varied cyclically with the seasons. The removal efficiency and the first-order volumetric removal rate constant (k(V)) increased exponentially with water temperature, yielding a high temperature coefficient (0). However, the mass removal rate decreased exponentially as temperature increased. These contradictory results made the actual effect of temperature uncertain. The inhibition of high water salinity on AN removal was also unclear because k(V) (as well as k(V20)) and mass removal rate were inversely proportional to salinity. However, mass loading rate (MLR) predominantly affected both the removal efficiency and the mass removal rate of AN, both of which were factors that explicitly determined seasonality. A power equation, k(v20)' a MLR-n, was proposed to correct the variation of the mass loading rate in estimating k(V) and thus in designing a constructed wetland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

DE chlorothalonil; chlorpyrifos; constructed wetlands; pesticide mixtures
ID AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; MITIGATION; STABILITY; WATER
AB Chlorpyrifos (an insecticide) and chlorothalonil (a fungicide) are transported in stormwater runoff and can be lethal to receiving aquatic system biota. This study determined removal rates of chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil in simulated stormwater runoff treated in constructed wetland mesocosms. Using sentinel species, Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas, observed declines in toxicity of the simulated runoff after treatment were 98 and 100%, respectively. First order removal rates were 0.039/h for chlorpyrifos and 0.295/h for chlorothalonil in these experiments. Constructed wetland mesocosms were effective for decreasing concentrations of chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil in simulated stormwater runoff, and decreasing P. promelas and C. dubia mortality resulting from these exposures. The results from this study indicate that constructed wetlands could be part of an efficient mitigation strategy for stormwater runoff containing these pesticides. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hydrology of wetlands located in urban landscapes is likely to be affected by the numerous effects of urban development on the water cycle. Although urbanization is affecting an increasingly large amount of wetland area, there have been few studies documenting hydrologic patterns in such wetlands. We have studied a set of 21 forested wetlands distributed through northeastern New Jersey, USA, a region characterized by dense residential and commercial development. The sites varied widely in area (6-500 ha), and all were bordered by urban land uses. In ten sites, water levels were monitored for 2.5 yr in shallow wells and piezometers; in all sites, qualitative indicators of hydrology, vegetation, and soil indicators of wetland hydrology were sampled. The sites were placed in five hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes (depression, slope, riverine, mineral flats, and mineral flat-riverine) and also in three qualitative classes of hydrologic disturbance (low, medium, and high). We examined water-level dynamics, variability, the occurrence of discharge/recharge conditions, and the frequency of occurrence of hydrologic indicators across both HGM and disturbance classifications. Qualitative indicators of hydrology did not reveal differences in hydrology that were apparent from the quantitative data, the soils, and the vegetation. Mineral flat-riverine sites were the most wet, and the riverine sites the most dry, but hydrologic disturbance tended to blur distinctions among HGM classes by creating relatively dry conditions in most site types. Sites with a high level of hydrologic disturbance also tended to be more "flashy," regardless of HGM class. We conclude that the utility of HGM classifications and qualitative indicators of hydrology in urban/suburban landscapes are limited by the high degree of variability in both the extent and particularly the sources of hydrologic disturbance. We conclude that the hydrology of wetlands in an urban region reflects not only the hydrogeomorphic setting but also the unique set of disturbances from current and historical land-uses found at each site.

AB Submerged macrophytes are important components of wetland ecosystems in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America, but factors influencing species abundance and community structure are poorly known. We sampled submerged macrophyte communities and habitat characteristics in 18 prairie wetlands for five years in order to 1) assess interspecific relationships between macrophyte species, 2) test for presence of distinct species assemblages at the whole-basin level, and 3) identify relationships between community composition and limnological characteristics of the wetland basins. Macrophyte communities did not occur as distinct assemblages of species; most species showed eurytopic distributions, and communities varied along gradients of individual species abundances. Redundancy analysis showed that turbidity, presence/absence of fish, drainage history (restored versus non-drained), average depth, and surface area explained 20% of the variance in species abundance. However, turbidity and drainage history alone accounted for 15% of this variance. Most species showed a negative relationship with turbidity, while drainage history influenced community composition but had little effect on overall abundance at the community level. Our results indicate that restored and non-drained wetlands have similar species richness but differ in species composition. Species richness and total plant abundance in both restored and non-drained wetlands will be greatest in wetlands with low turbidity, moderate depth, and small surface area. However, substantial residual variation indicates that additional, unstudied factors are important determinants of community structure.

AB Aquatic invertebrates are essential components of duckling diets, but little is known about temporal changes of invertebrate populations in different types of brood habitats. In spring and summer 1996 and 1997, we conducted searches for duck nests in upland fields in the Grasslands Ecological Area in California's Central Valley to determine timing of nest initiation and hatching. We also sampled aquatic invertebrate populations in adjacent permanent wetlands, semi-permanent borrow areas within seasonal wetlands that were drawn down in spring, and reverse-cycle wetlands (i.e., wetlands flooded from spring to summer) to estimate invertebrate food resources available to ducklings. Abundances of many invertebrates important in duckling diets (Gastropoda, Cladocera, Ostracoda, Amphipoda, Corixidae, Dytiscidae, Hydrophilidae) were greater in borrow areas and reverse-cycle wetlands than in permanent wetlands. Peak macroinvertebrate densities in borrow areas occurred immediately after adjacent wetlands are drawn down in March-April. Peak densities in reverse-cycle wetlands and permanent wetlands occur in May. Although total numbers of microinvertebrates (<1 mm size) and macroinvertebrates (<1 mm size) in all wetlands decreased after May, most mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and cinnamon teal (A. cyanoptera) eggs hatched in May. Therefore, these ducklings hatch when abundant invertebrate food resources were most available in reverse-cycle wetlands. In contrast, most gadwall (A. strepera) eggs hatched in June after invertebrate numbers started to decrease. In areas where hydrology is controlled, managing for reverse-cycle wetlands may be a useful strategy to provide abundant invertebrate food resources during the waterfowl breeding season.

AB We compared the ecophysiological performance of four dominant, perennial plant species of tidal marshes of northeastern North America (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Spartina alterniflora, and Leersia oryzoides), asking whether species that fall along a continuum of invasiveness vary consistently in terms of primary productivity, growth, biomass allocation, phenology, maximal photosynthetic rate, leaf turnover, tissue nutrient and chlorophyll content, and water use. During 1999, we examined plants growing at two brackish marshes and two freshwater tidal marshes in southern Connecticut, USA. Phragmites and Typha consistently exceeded the other two species in both marsh types in terms of ramet biomass, standing crop, length of the growing season, standing leaf area, leaf longevity, and total chlorophyll. Typha, Phragmites, and Spartina showed similar maximal photosynthetic rates across marsh types, significantly greater than the P-max observed in Leersia. Foliar nitrogen was significantly greater in Phragmites than in all other species, suggesting that this species accrues nutrients more efficiently. Phragmites and Typha populations did not differ in a number of characters between freshwater and brackish marshes, indicating low sensitivity to exposure to moderate salinity levels. A principle components analysis placed Phragmites and Typha close to each other and more distant from Spartina and Leersia along axes describing components of competitive ability and photosynthetic performance. Thus, moderately and highly invasive species are distinct from less invasive species in terms of ecophysiology in both wetland types. As Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia displace other plant species in marshes, they will likely influence the carbon- and nitrogen-cycling functions of wetlands, subject to the species' varying tolerances for salinity.

AB The ability of coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes to reduce pollution from tributaries has not been documented in detail or over multiple seasons. This study developed a surface-water budget for a coastal wetland along Lake Erie and estimated monthly, annual, and storm-related exports of total suspended solids and selected nutrients from the wetland. Water-budget measurements included precipitation, evaporation, surface discharge into the wetland, and net surface discharge into Lake Erie. Water samples collected upstream and downstream and composite dryfall-precipitation samples were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite nitrogen (NO2+3) ammonia nitrogen (NH3), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), soluble reactive silica, chloride, and specific conductance. Seasonal and storm-related concentration patterns and a wide variation in monthly, seasonal, and annual loads from the tributary into the wetland were typical of streams draining the western Lake Erie basin. All substances reached higher maximum concentrations upstream than downstream; however, median monthly time-weighted mean concentrations of TP, TSS, NH3, and TKN were higher downstream. Concentrations without discharge data were inadequate to estimate removal rates. Annual loads of TSS, NH3, and TKN increased during passage through the wetland, whereas those of TP, SRP, NO2+3, and soluble reactive silica decreased. During storm runoff events, various proportions of TP, SRP, TSS, NO2+3, and soluble reactive silica were removed, despite brief hydraulic residence times, whereas more NH3 exited than entered. Wetlands occupying the flooded lower reaches of Great Lakes tributaries collectively are probably important in maintaining and enhancing the water and sediment quality of the lakes. Water levels throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes have decreased in recent years; consequently, wetland areas with standing water and hydraulic residence times have decreased, probably reducing the effectiveness of the wetlands in mitigating pollution.

AB Annual and seasonal variations in precipitation have been shown to influence the hydrology of nontidal wetlands, including depth to water table. Water-table depth is assessed in wetlands for a variety of reasons, most notably for wetland delineations or determining the success of restoration projects. Many short-term assessment efforts probably occur during periods of abnormal precipitation and, as such, may not provide a thorough understanding of wetland hydrology. I have been evaluating water-table dynamics of a wetlands complex in western North Carolina for seven years in support of a wetlands restoration project. A series of water-table wells and piezometers were installed to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of the water table and vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG). For over three years, the area was classified as having conditions of moderate to severe drought. The drought lowered the average monthly water table by 26 cm in a mountain fen and 22 cm in the adjacent floodplain. The fen was a constant ground-water recharge area before the drought and a discharge area for three of 12 months during the drought. The drought also impacted a shallow, constant ground-water source to the fen on an adjacent hillslope. The impacts of the drought were greater during the active growing season, presumably due to increased evapotranspiration. The results support the need for long-term hydrologic assessment of wetlands and the need to relate wetland hydrology to annual, seasonal, and monthly precipitation patterns.

AB ddConstructed wetlands are recognized as a means to improve water quality through nitrogen (N) removal. Water-quality concerns in the N-sensitive Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA, have necessitated enactment of a 30% reduction in nitrogen (N) loading accompanied by an N loading cap. Open Grounds Farm (OGF) is an 18,220-ha row-crop farm located in the lower Neuse River Estuary. In 1999, a wetland was constructed to remove nutrients (N and Phosphorus), sediment, and pathogens in surface water draining from a 971-ha area of OGF. The wetland site is 5.1 ha of alternating segments of emergent marsh and open water. Nitrogen removal from the wetland via denitrification was measured monthly by analysis of dissolved nitrogen, oxygen, and argon in laboratory incubated sediment chambers using a Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer (MIMS). Nitrate concentration appeared to be the primary variable controlling denitrification rates. Spatial and temporal variability in rates of denitrification were investigated, including pre- and post-N loading events. Following rainfall, there was a 400% increase in denitrification rates in response to increased inorganic N loading. Nutrient loads entering and leaving the wetland were determined from nutrient analysis (twice monthly), intensive precipitation event sampling, and continuous flow measurements at the entrance and exit of the wetland. Results indicated that the wetland received variable N loading (1-1,720 kg N per month) and had variable N removal via denitrification (8-81 kg N per month). Denitritication was an important mechanism for N removal.

AB Irrigation practices may have adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems. Quantification of such impacts is possible only if a condition of an aquatic ecosystem is known before the impacts started. This study attempted to simulate the reference hydrologic regimes of three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka, two of which are currently receiving return flows from upstream irrigation scheme. The lagoon that does not receive irrigation drainage flows is considered to be a reference wetland. The simulation of its water volumes and levels was carried out using a daily water-balance model. The model assumed that a lagoon may be described as a reservoir, which is separated from the sea by a sand bar. The simulated water levels in a reference lagoon were then modified to describe water-level fluctuation in the other two lagoons. This modification uses a spatial interpolation approach based on duration curves and incorporates information received from local farmers. The probable changes caused by irrigation drainage flows to two lagoons can be illustrated by duration curves of observed and simulated water levels.

AB This experiment tested the hypothesis that the movement of water into the soil due to macrophyte transpiration stimulates nitrate removal from wetlands. The short-term impacts of biomass harvesting upon the ability of wetlands to reduce nitrate concentrations were also investigated. Different amounts of biomass were harvested from Typha latifolia specimens to create three treatments of varying transpiration rates. Harvesting and the resulting different rates of transpiration explained between 10 and 38% of the variation in nitrate reduction during the 10-day experiment and had significant effects upon nitrate concentrations. Greater rates of harvesting and lower rates of transpiration resulted in decreased reductions of nitrate in the surface water of the microcosms. During the first four days of the experiment, 70% and 85% rates of aboveground harvesting reduced transpiration by 63% and 91%, respectively. These changes led to respective decreases in nitrate reduction of 16% and 31% compared to unharvested treatments. Differences in nitrate reduction between the treatments were minimal in the later days of the experiment as nitrate concentrations decreased. Results support the hypothesis that water movement due to plant uptake contributes to nitrogen removal and offers a partial explanation for increased nitrogen removal in vegetated wetland treatment systems. Decreased reduction of nitrate with greater harvesting demonstrates potential negative impacts on water quality improvement when using wetlands as bio-energy production systems.

AB Planting Spartina patens (Salt Meadow Cord Grass) is an integral part of restoring salt marshes along Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Of the salt marsh species that are planted, S. patens often has the lowest survivorship. State managers have hypothesized that this low survivorship is related to transplant shock and to acidic soil conditions commonly found under dense stands of Casuarina sp. (Australian Pine), an exotic invasive. This study documents planted S. patens health and survivorship over 11 months at a restoration site previously dominated by Casuarina sp. Three plots of 100 plants each were established in varying soil pH, with each plot covering above and below the recommended elevation range for S. patens. Transplant shock occurred within the first thirty days after planting and affected overall survival. Spartina patens survival was not affected by soil pH (p = 0.827) as evidenced by the presence of healthy individuals outside the plots, in soil pH ranging from 4.76 to 8.94. However, there was a sharp decline in plant health when redox potentials fell below -50 mV. Although elevation and redox potential were highly correlated (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.736), plant health varied more with elevation (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.387) than redox potential (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.950), suggesting that elevation, while a good coarse predictor of site suitability, may not always be the best measure. Redox potential should be monitored, in addition to measuring elevation, to avoid planting in highly reduced areas. Furthermore, adjusting the lower limit of the target elevation range to a higher elevation will increase the amount of survivorship.

AB A major obstacle to assessing functional equivalency of restored or created wetlands is the time needed to develop the functions of natural wetlands. We compared hydrologic, water-quality, and vegetationcomposition functions of nine natural coastal plain ponds in the New Jersey Pinelands with those of four small, well-established excavated basins that are. at least 50 years old. Our study revealed that well-established (> 50 yr old) excavated ponds achieved a moderate degree of functional equivalency with Pinelands wetlands, representing a range of coastal plain pond characteristics. Based on water-depth-fluctuation patterns and the similarity of most hydrologic indices, including high-water pond area, mean water depth, area of exposed substrate (drawdown), and the presence of a clay lens, the excavated ponds seemed to achieve hydrologic equivalency with the natural reference wetlands. However, steeper bank slopes found at most of the excavated ponds affected nearshore water depths and resulted in the absence of plant zonation that characterizes coastal plain ponds. The water-quality function, represented by pH, specific conductance, and total organic carbon, differed between pond types. The pH and specific conductance of the excavated ponds were higher and total organic carbon concentrations were lower compared with the natural ponds. We attributed these differences to landscape setting, reflected by adjacent vegetation and contrasting plant zonation. Elevated specific conductance values in the natural ponds were likely due to the higher hydrogen ion concentrations. Reduced light transmission due to higher organic carbon concentrations in the natural ponds may have greater ecological importance. However, differences in water-quality functions between the pond types may make excavated ponds more prone to changes in pH if constructed within landscapes with extensive developed or agricultural lands. The excavated ponds met or exceeded most vegetation-composition reference criteria associated with the natural wetlands. Total and herbaceous species richness were greater in the excavated ponds. Most importantly, the excavated ponds supported a native Pinelands species composition, thus preserving regional biodiversity. Because all ponds were acidic and displayed pH values within the range associated with native Pinelands plants, differences in pH may not have been the cause of the greater species richness. Although overall species composition differed between the two pond types, the flora of the created wetlands was similar to that of coastal plain ponds found in other regions and other areas of the Pinelands. The major difference in vegetation composition between ponds was both the lack of distinct vegetation zonation due to steeper slopes and lower patch-type diversity in the excavated ponds. These structural differences can be overcome by constructing ponds with slopes that are comparable to natural ponds. Because the transitional-upland location of the excavated ponds is a more likely location for a mitigation wetland, the effect of landscape setting on water quality may not be as easily remedied as the lack of nearshore slopes.

AB Responses of wetland abiotic variables and aquatic invertebrate community structure to cattle stocking density, pasture type, and dominant vegetation were evaluated in subtropical pastures. Cattle were stocked at four treatment levels on improved (fertilized) and semi-native (unfertilized) pastures in south-central Florida, USA. Improved pasture wetlands were dominated either by Panicum hemitomon (maiden-cane) or by a mixture of Polygonum spp. (smartweed) and Juncus effusus; semi-native pasture wetlands were dominated mainly by maidencane. Cattle stocking density had few significant effects on water-column nutrient concentration or invertebrate community structure. However, water-column nutrient concentrations were significantly greater in the wetlands on improved pastures compared to semi-native pastures. Invertebrate richness and diversity were greater in wetlands on semi-native pastures than on improved pastures, despite lower nutrient concentrations in the former. Overall, the cattle stocking treatment had little impact on invertebrate community structure in these systems relative to prior pasture land use. However, vegetation type influenced invertebrate communities and explained some of the differences between pasture types. Semi-native (lower nutrient) wetland pastures dominated by maidencane had significantly greater invertebrate richness and diversity than improved (higher nutrient) wetland pastures dominated by mixed vegetation but showed no difference when compared to improved wetland pastures dominated by maidencane. Chironomids were the dominant invertebrate in wetlands of both pasture types. Correspondence analysis revealed that ostracods and Culicidae larvae might be useful as bioindicators of subtropical wetlands that are experiencing cultural eutrophication.

AB We investigated the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi on common cattails (Typha latifolia), a ubiquitous wetland plant species. The mycorrhizal relationship, which involves the exchange of fungal-acquired nutrients and plant-produced carbon, has been shown to elicit a range of physiological and biochemical responses in host plants. Growth, photosynthetic activity, biomass accumulation, and nutrition were compared between seedlings inoculated with viable mycorrhizal fungal spores and control seedlings given a sterilized inoculum. Plants were grown in inundated soils at three levels of phosphorous availability under glasshouse conditions for 11 weeks. The presence of arbuscules and hyphae was confirmed in all inoculated plants with levels of infection reaching 23.1 and 34.1%, respectively. Control plants were taller and had greater above- and below-ground biomass. Photosynthetic rates measured at week 11 of the experiment were significantly higher in mycorrhizal plants than in control plants. Mycorrhizal plants had higher concentrations of N, P, and C in their shoots and higher concentrations of N in their roots. Our results suggest that under greenhouse conditions, the fungus acts to reduce host plant growth despite increased mineral nutrition and photosynthetic activity.

AB Aquatic invertebrates are important food resources for wintering waterbirds, and prey selection generally is limited by prey size. Aquatic invertebrate communities are influenced by sediments and hydrologic characteristics of wetlands, which were affected by structural marsh management (levees, water-control structures and impoundments; SMM) and salinity on the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain of North America. Based on previous research, we tested general predictions that SMM reduces biomass of infaunal invertebrates and increases that of epifaunal invertebrates and those that tolerate low levels of dissolved oxygen (O-2) and salinity. We also tested the general prediction that invertebrate biomass in freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline marshes are similar, except for taxa adapted to specific ranges of salinity. Finally, we investigated relationships among invertebrate biomass and sizes, sediment and hydrologic variables, and marsh types. Accordingly, we measured biomass of common invertebrate by three size classes (63 to 199 mum, 200 to 999 mum, and greater than or equal to1000 mum), sediment variables (carbon content, C:N ratio, hardness, particle size, and O-2 penetration), and hydrologic variables (salinity, water depth, temperature, O-2, and turbidity) in ponds of impounded freshwater (IF), oligohaline (IO), mesohaline (IM), and unimpounded mesohaline (UM) marshes during winters 1997-1998 to 1999-2000 on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, near Grand Chenier, Louisiana, USA. As predicted, an a priori multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) contrast indicated that biomass of an infaunal class of invertebrates (Nematoda, 63 to 199 mum) was greater in UM marsh ponds than in those of IM marshes, and biomass of an epifaunal class of invertebrates (Ostracoda, 200 to 999 mum) was greater in IM marsh ponds than in those of UM marshes. The observed reduction in Nematoda due to SMM also was consistent with the prediction that SMM reduces invertebrates that do not tolerate low salinity. Furthermore, as predicted, an a priori MANOVA contrast indicated that biomass of a single invertebrate class adapted to low salinity (Oligochaeta, 200 to 999 mum) was greater in ponds of IF marshes than in those of 10 and IM marshes. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that variation in salinity and O-2 penetration best explained differences among sites that maximized biomass of the common invertebrate classes. Salinity was positively correlated with the silt-clay fraction, O-2, and O-2 penetration, and negatively correlated with water depth, sediment hardness, carbon, and C:N. Nematoda, Foraminifera, and Copepoda generally were associated with UM marsh ponds and high salinity, whereas other invertebrate classes were distributed among impounded marsh ponds and associated with lower salinity. Our results suggest that SMM and salinity have relatively small effects on invertebrate prey of wintering waterbirds in marsh ponds because they affect biomass of Nematoda and Oligochaeta, and few waterbirds consume these invertebrates.

AB Shrub cover was quantified by species for a 1.9-ha shrub carr adjacent to White Clay Lake near Shawano, WI, USA and related to soil properties and sedimentation rates. Principal components analysis of soil characteristics distinguished two distinct groups: alluvial surface soils having organic matter contents less than 30 g/100g and histic surface soils having organic matter contents averaging 56 g/100g. The alluvial surface soils were on slightly elevated natural levees along a relict stream bed that had received 1.3 cm/yr of silty sediments from agricultural runoff. Alluvial surface soils had twice the bulk density and organic P concentrations, nearly three times the reactive P, and 4.5 times the NO3-N concentrations of histic surface soils. Total shrub cover and shrub overlap was significantly greater on the alluvial surface soils, but there was no difference between the two soil groups in proportion of open space, suggesting that the increased total shrub cover on alluvial surface soils was due to increased shrub layering rather than infilling of canopy gaps. Shrub diversity was greater on the alluvial surface soils: average shrub species richness per 30.5 m line segment was five species on alluvial surface soils as opposed to three species on histic surface soils. Four willow species were strongly associated with the alluvial surface soils and may serve as indicators of sediment deposition: Salix discolor, S. eriocephala, S. interior, and S. lucida. The most common shrub species present, Cornus sericea spp. sericea and Salix petiolaris, were poor indicators of soil conditions within the wetland.

AB Urban wetlands, despite their imperfections, provide natural and aesthetic landscape diversity in the built environment. We are beginning to understand and document the ecological significance of this diversity and the management challenges presented by the urban context. The cultural significance of urban wetlands has not received similar attention. The research presented in this paper explores the relationship between people and wetlands in local neighborhood settings. We surveyed residents of three urban communities in the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada for their knowledge about and perceptions of a small wetland in each of their respective neighborhoods. Results of the survey show that the study participants are aware of the wetlands in their midst but are not especially observant of or knowledgeable about 'their' sites, nor do they visit their wetlands regularly. Yet, despite this apparent disinterest, they readily identify the wetlands as part of their neighborhoods and as assets, especially as natural features and habitat for urban wildlife. The study participants do not consider these neighborhood wetlands nuisance environments or a waste of land. Instead, respondents revealed an appreciation of the aesthetic attributes and habitat value of wetlands in the city and of urban natural spaces.

AB Using minirhizotrons, fine root dynamics were compared in two Atlantic white-cedar swamps with contrasting hydroperiods (intermittently and persistently flooded) in order to evaluate the effects of flooding regime on fine root depth, abundance, production, and longevity. Despite the higher mean water-table depth in the persistently flooded site, no differences in rooting depth were observed. Root length density, root abundance, and root longevity were generally greater in the persistently flooded site throughout the 439-day study period, although root length production was similar between the two sites. These results suggest that prolonged inundation in Atlantic white-cedar swamps decreases root elongation rates, but due to greater observed root densities, stand-level belowground production remains similar to that of intermittently flooded stands. Significant increases in root mortality were observed in the intermittently flooded site during a period of water-table drawdown, suggesting less than optimal hydrologic conditions at this site.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae, which are plant root-fungal symbioses, are common associates of vascular plants. Such relationships, however, are thought to be rare in wetland plant roots, although several recent studies suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizae may be important in wetland ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine (1) the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots in three freshwater marshes and (2) the effect of restoration status, hydrologic zone, and plant species identity on mycorrhizal colonization. We quantified the percentage of plant roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi in one reference and two restored freshwater marshes in northern Indiana, USA during summer 1999. Roots were collected from soil cores taken around dominant plant species present in each of three hydrologic zones and then stained for microscopic examination of mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizae were present in each wetland, in all hydrologic zones and in all sampled plants, including Carex and Scirpus species previously thought to be non-mycorrhizal. Both restored and reference wetlands had moderate levels of mycorrhizal colonization, but no clear trends in colonization were seen with hydrologic zone, which has been hypothesized to regulate the formation of mycorrhizae in wetlands. Mycorrhizal colonization levels in the roots of individual species ranged from 3 to 90% and were particularly large in members of the Poaceae (grass) family. Our results suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizae may be widely distributed across plant species and hydrologic zones in both restored and reference freshwater marshes. Thus, future research should examine the functional role of mycorrhizal fungi in freshwater wetlands.

AB We studied a Great Lakes peatland protected by a barrier dune system to test the hypothesis that changes in the morphology of a barrier beach alter the wetland surface-water and ground-water hydrology such that the plant rooting zone in the wetland interior might be affected. Hydraulic head measured in observation wells located on transects perpendicular to a flow-through channel, uplands, and Lake Ontario were compared to lake-level changes, weather patterns, and the temporal conditions of the barrier beach. Water-table elevations within the wetland complex always remained 0.35 to 0.84 m above Lake Ontario's water level (mean difference = 0.62 m) and did not fluctuate in parallel with changes in the lake's water level. Flooding events occurred when breaches closed and isolated the wetland complex from Lake Ontario; daily average water levels rose between 0.06 m and 0.27 m. When the barrier beach was breached naturally or by human activity, daily average water-table elevations in the wetland receded between 0.16 m and 0.41 m. During the growing season, vertical ground-water-flow directions also changed as a function of changing hydraulics controlled by the barrier beach. Vertical recharge-discharge gradients ranged from -0.2 to 0.1 m.m(-1). Water-table elevation and hydraulic head gradients across the study area were controlled primarily by short-term (days to weeks) changes in shoreline geomorphology, whereas seasonal weather patterns and Lake Ontario water-level fluctuations imposed secondary controls on the ground-water-flow regime.

AB Riparian wetlands have a demonstrated ability to filter and control nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) movement into streams and other bodies of water; few studies, however, have examined the roles that individual plant species serve in sequestering N and P pollutants. We evaluated the potential for growth and consequent N and P accumulation by five species of wetland perennials. We planted blocks consisting of 900-cm(2) plots of each species at 11 sites within a riparian wetland that receives large inputs of agricultural runoff. Plant shoots and roots were collected at the time of peak standing crop to determine net accumulation of biomass, N, and P for one growing season. A portion of the plant shoots was placed in decomposition litterbags in the field to determine biomass, N, and P losses for 60, 120, and 150 days. Of the five species, bur reed (Sparganium americanum) had the greatest aboveground accumulation of N and P but had the lowest belowground accumulation values. In contrast, woolgrass (Scirpus cyperinus) had the lowest aboveground values for N and P accumulation but had the highest belowground value for P. Soft rush (Juncus effusus) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) showed high values for both aboveground and belowground N and P accumulation, while blue joint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis) showed low values for aboveground N and P. The five species also showed wide variations in the retention of N and P in decomposing shoots. Juncus effusus had the highest percentages of N and P remaining in litter after five months (87% N and 69% P), while P. arundinacea retained only 28% N and 18% P. Sparganium americanum had high retention rate for N in litter (74% N) but showed low P retention values (35%). Scirpus cyperinus and C canadensis also showed high retention rates of litter N but lower values for P retention. Our study suggests that species show differential accumulation and release of N and P and may influence the overall potential of a wetland to retain agricultural nutrients.

AB Hydroperiod is considered the primary determinant of plant species distribution in temperate floodplain forests, but most studies have focused on alluvial (sediment-laden) river systems. Few studies have evaluated plant community relationships in blackwater river systems of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of North America. In this study, we characterized the soils, hydroperiod, and vegetation communities and evaluated relationships between the physical and chemical environment and plant community structure on the floodplain of the Coosawhatchie River, a blackwater river in South Carolina, USA. The soils were similar to previous descriptions of blackwater floodplain soils but had greater soil N and P availability, substantially greater clay content, and lower soil silt content than was previously reported for other blackwater river floodplains. Results of a cluster analysis showed there were five forest communities on the site, and both short-term (4 years) and long-term (50 years) flooding records documented a flooding gradient: water tupelo community > swamp tupelo > laurel oak = overcup oak > mixed oak. The long-term hydrologic record showed that the floodplain has flooded less frequently from 1994 to present than in previous decades. Detrended correspondence analysis of environmental and relative basal area values showed that 27% of the variation in overstory community structure could be explained by the first two axes; however, fitting the species distributions to the DCA axes using Gaussian regression explained 67% of the variation. Axes were correlated with elevation (flooding intensity) and soil characteristics related to rooting volume and cation nutrient availability. Our study suggests that flooding is the major factor affecting community structure, but soil characteristics also may be factors in community structure in blackwater systems.

AB Conservation efforts require detailed knowledge of a species' habitat use and movements about the landscape. We radio-tracked sympatric congeners,,the Copperbelly Water Snake (Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta) and the Northern Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon sipedon) in northwestern Ohio and southern Michigan, USA, to investigate differences in the use of wetland and upland habitats between species. Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta used twice as many wetlands (4.1 +/- 0.4) as N. s. sipedon (2.1 +/- 0.3), moved between these wetlands three times more often (9.1 +/- 1.9 times) than N. s. sipedon (2.8 +/- 1.0 times), and moved to small wetlands seven times more often (3.6 +/- 0.7 times) than N. s. sipedon (0.5 +/- 0.3 times). Nearly 30% of N. e. neglecta locations were in uplands, sometimes over 100 m from the nearest wetland. Less than 3% of N. s. sipedon locations were in upland habitats, and all locations were < 30 m from wetlands. We simulated the impact of small wetland loss and demonstrated that N. e. neglecta would need to move longer than normal distances when traveling between wetlands after small wetlands are lost, while N. s. sipedon would not. The northernmost populations of N. e. neglecta are listed as federally threatened and state endangered in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana; N. s. sipedon remains abundant in this region. Historic and current wetland losses in the midwestern United States may have severely impacted N. e. neglecta populations due to this species' high vagility and use of numerous wetlands. Protection and restoration of wetland landscapes are critical for the long-term persistence of many wetland-associated species, including N. e. neglecta.

AB The Hole-in-the-Donut is a 4000-ha region of former farmlands within Everglades National Park that is dominated by a monoculture of the non-indigenous pest plant Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper). Prior to extensive farming in the region, the area consisted of short hydroperiod graminoid wetlands and mesic pine savannah. Rock plowing in preparation of these lands for farming created an artificial soil layer that broke up the limestone substrate, mixed and aerated the native marl soil layer with the broken limestone, and elevated the surface slightly. Farming practices also included the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The modified soil substrate quickly became dominated by S. terebinthifolius when farming ceased in 1975, despite efforts to control its establishment, such as prescribed fire, herbicide treatment, and mowing. Preliminary evidence indicated that soil removal would prevent re-invasion by S. terebinthifolius and could lead to colonization by native wetlands plants. Two trials, a partial soil removal (PSR) and a compete soil removal (CSR), were performed on a pilot test site beginning in 1989 to determine whether all or only a portion of this modified soil substrate needed to be removed to attain desired results. Removal of rock-plowed surface material lowered elevation in both treatments. While the PSR treatment did show an increase in the number and coverage of hydrophytes for a few years, it did not prohibit re-colonization and re-establishment of a canopy of S. terebinthifolius, and by 1996, the site was again dominated by a monoculture of S. terebinthifolius. By contrast, the CSR treatment showed rapid colonization by hydrophytes and no successful. re-colonization by S. terebinthifolius. Lowering elevations by 15 to 45 cm allowed for longer periods of flooding and rapid colonization by hydrophytes on both sites. After the sites were cleared, the average difference in elevation between the two treatment areas was less than a tenth of a meter, but this resulted in a slightly shorter hydroperiod on the PSR site. The small amount of residual rock-plowed soil with high levels of nutrients, along with its slightly shorter hydroperiod on the PSR site, appear to have contributed significantly to the success of S. terebinthifolius in re-colonizing this treatment area.

Consequently, much uncertainty exists about the appropriate timeframes and best criteria for evaluating responses to wetland restoration. We studied aspects of pond colonization and long-term community dynamics in ponds created at a mitigation site in western North Carolina. We examined whether landscape variables influenced the initial colonization of 22 constructed ponds and conducted a long-term study of changes in species richness and community composition in ten constructed and ten reference ponds over seven breeding seasons. During the first year of pond filling, species richness and the number of egg masses of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) were positively correlated with pond size, depth, and hydroperiod but independent of distance to the nearest forest, paved road, or source pond. The ten constructed ponds in the long-term study first filled in 1996 and were larger, deeper, warmer, more oxygen-rich, and of longer seasonal hydroperiod than reference ponds. Seven species bred in the constructed ponds during the first year of filling, and species richness reached equilibrium within two years of initial pond filling. Most species colonized constructed ponds rapidly, but frequency of use by eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) increased slowly over five years. Constructed ponds supported significantly more species than reference ponds, and the annual turnover rate of breeding populations was approximately 25% for both pond types. Our data suggest that post-restoration monitoring for 2-3 years may be sufficient to characterize species and communities that will utilize ponds for the first decade or so after pond creation.

AB The common reed, Phragmites australis, is a common feature in wetlands across North America. Recent studies have suggested that the widespread invasions of this species may be due to the introduction of a non-native strain from EurAsia. Since native populations persist in many areas where introduced populations are also found, a method for distinguishing population types is needed to facilitate management of the species. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was developed to distinguish native, non-native, and Gulf Coast type populations of Phragmites from each other. Two amplified non-coding chloroplast DNA regions are each cut with one restriction enzyme, allowing the distinction of native, non-native and Gulf Coast haplotypes from each other. When used together, these cut sites provide a low cost, rapid way of determining the origin of Phragmites populations.

AB While many wetlands form along floodplains of rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries, others have developed in depressions far removed from such waters. Depressional wetlands completely surrounded by upland have traditionally been called "isolated wetlands." Isolated wetlands are not confined to basins, as some occur on broad flats and others form on slopes. The term "geographically isolated wetlands" better describes these wetlands, since many are hydrologically connected to other wetlands and waterbodies through ground-water flows or by intermittent overflows (spillovers). Numerous types of geographically isolated wetlands occur throughout the United States. They may be naturally formed or the result of human action. Naturally formed types include prairie pothole wetlands, playas, Nebraska's Rainwater Basin and Sandhills wetlands, West Coast vernal pools, sinkhole wetlands, Carolina bays, interdunal and intradunal wetlands, desert springs, terminal basins in the Great Basin, and kettle-hole bogs in glaciated regions. Human-caused isolated types may be intentionally built, such as ponds designed for various purposes and wetlands built on mined lands, or they may be accidentially created (e.g., natural wetlands that were once connected to rivers and streams but are now isolated by roads, railroads, and other development or isolated by altered river hydrology). Many of the functions and benefits attributed to non-isolated wetlands are present in isolated wetlands.

AB The recent U.S. Supreme Court case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) has had profound implications on the legal status of isolated wetlands. As a result, policymakers need ecological information on the definition and functions of isolated wetlands to respond to this decision. The term "isolated wetlands" is of fairly recent usage and has been poorly defined. In response, I recommend Titter's (2003b) definition as wetlands "that are completely surrounded by upland." Isolation needs to be considered with respect to specific processes and functions. I suggest that isolation not be viewed discretely but be considered within an isolation-connectivity continuum. Isolation has a fundamental influence on the way water enters and leaves a wetland. This consequently affects any wetland function that depends on water as a vector (e.g., pollutant transport and certain types of dispersal). These wetlands can also have a high level of endemism, extensive plant zonation, and high biodiversity. Isolated wetlands, however, do not represent ecologically isolated habitat for many organisms. I conclude that the effect of isolation may not be as significant as the term "isolated wetlands" suggests: many of the biological features of isolated wetlands may result from environmental conditions that also occur in non-isolated wetlands. As a result of SWANCC, assessment methods are needed that can help regulators distinguish between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional isolated wetlands. I propose that the merger of simple, source-sink-transport vector concepts with landscape-level assessment methods could be useful in this regard. I point to the need for documented examples of organisms that spend most of their lives in waters of the U.S. but also require isolated wetlands. I conclude that wetland science would benefit from the development of a comprehensive view of isolation as a formative process across different regional wetland types.

TI Hydrologic considerations in defining isolated wetlands
SO WETLANDS

   surface water interaction
ID COMPLEX; LAKES
AB Wetlands that are not connected by streams to other surface-water bodies are considered to be isolated. Although the definition is based on surface-water connections to other water bodies, isolated wetlands commonly are integral parts of extensive ground-water flow systems, and isolated wetlands can spill over their surface divides into adjacent surface-water bodies during periods of abundant precipitation and high water levels. Thus, characteristics of ground-water flow and atmospheric-water flow affect the isolation of wetlands. In general, the degree that isolated wetlands are connected through the ground-water system to other surface water bodies depends to a large extent on the rate that ground water moves and the rate that hydrologic stresses can be transmitted through the ground-water system. Water that seeps from an isolated wet-land into a gravel aquifer can travel many kilometers through the ground-water system in one year. In contrast, water that seeps from an isolated wetland into a clayey or silty substrate may travel less than one meter in one year. For wetlands that can spill over their surface watersheds during periods of wet climate conditions, their isolation is related to the height to a spill elevation above normal wetland water level and the recurrence interval of various magnitudes of precipitation. The concepts presented in this paper indicate that the entire hydrologic system needs to be considered in establishing a definition of hydrologic isolation.

AB Isolated wetlands occur in many hydrogeomorphic settings, and while they appear to be physically isolated from other water bodies, they are almost never completely decoupled from surface-water or groundwater systems. In this paper, we examine water-quality data for isolated wetlands in three hydrogeomorphic classes (depressions, slopes, flats). Some isolated wetlands are dominated by atmospheric exchanges and have little ground-water or surface-water connections with adjacent systems. Other isolated wetlands are dominated by ground-water inputs and have intermittent or continuous hydrologic connections to adjacent systems. Water-quality characteristics of isolated wetlands are highly variable and depend primarily on the sources of water, substrate characteristics, and land uses associated with the wetland watershed. We were unable to identify any general pattern of water-quality characteristics within or between isolated wetlands in the three hydrogeomorphic classes. Alteration of hydrologic conditions (e.g., ditching, filling), however, usually results in increased nutrient export to downstream systems. From a water-quality perspective, we conclude that so-called isolated wetlands are rarely isolated, and isolation is a term that is not very useful from an ecosystem perspective. Isolated wetlands are nutrient sinks and, because most are hydrologically connected to other waters and wetlands, the loss of isolated wetlands would potentially have negative impacts on the water quality of downstream systems.

AB Carolina bays, depression wetlands of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, are "islands" of high species richness within the upland landscape and are the major breeding habitat for numerous amphibians. The 2001 Supreme Court decision that removes isolated wetlands from protection under the Clean Water Act has potential for great losses of these wetland ecosystems. Most Carolina bays are not naturally connected with stream drainages or other water bodies, and their hydrology is driven primarily by rainfall and evapotranspiration. Their potential interaction with shallow ground water is not well-understood. Water levels in these wetlands may vary seasonally and across years from inundated to dry, and organisms inhabiting Carolina bays must be adapted to fluctuating and often unpredictable hydrologic conditions. The ecological importance of these wetlands as habitats for species that require an aquatic environment for a part of their life cycle has been well-documented. Many Carolina bays have been drained and converted to agriculture or other uses, and many of the smaller bays have been poorly inventoried and mapped. If these wetlands are not protected in the future, a major source of biological diversity in the southeastern United States will be lost.

TI Pocosins: Hydrologically isolated or integrated wetlands on the
   landscape?
SO WETLANDS
LA English

   geology; SWANCC
ID CAROLINA COASTAL-PLAIN; NORTH-CAROLINA; AVAILABILITY
AB Surveys have shown that pocosins (swamp-on-a-hill) occur on the southeastern Coastal Plain of the U.S. from Virginia to north Florida and once covered more than one million hectares in North Carolina. A broad definition of pocosins (sensu lato) would include all shrub and forested bogs, as well as Atlantic white cedar stands and some loblolly pine stands on flooded soils on the Coastal Plain. A stricter definition (sensu stricto) of pocosins would only include the classic shrub-scrub (short pocosin) and pond-pine-dominated tall pocosin. Common synonyms for pocosins, including bay, bayland, bayhead, xeric shrub bog, and evergreen shrub bog, further confuse what is and is not classified as a pocosin. Over 51% of the forested palustrine wetlands in North Carolina have been disturbed, with approximately 33% of pocosins having been destroyed. Pocosins are rainfall driven and lack a well-defined stream surface-flow connection to major rivers on the landscape. However, they are often found adjacent to estuaries and have surface hydrologic connections that are linked to the regional water quality and salinity gradients found in estuarine areas along the southeastern coast. This hydrologic connection, combined with the vast continuous expanses of pocosins on the landscape, suggests that they are connected to regulated tributary waters of the United States. In addition, a survey of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel in North Carolina indicates that most pocosins are considered hydrologically connected to regional water supplies since they are the source of water flow on the landscape where they dominate. However, the potential impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2001 decision in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) on the future development of pocosins is still unknown in most states. Moreover, the Bush administration's recent (January 2003) review and redefinition of the Clean Water Act's (CWA) jurisdiction over isolated wetlands may remove federal oversight on 20% of the nation's wetlands, including pocosins not immediately adjacent to estuaries. The high rate of past wetland loss, especially for pocosin wetlands, suggests that stricter wetland laws are needed at the state and local level if we are to support the concept of "no net loss" of wetlands.

AB Playa wetlands provide functions critical to the existence of life on the High Plains portion of the Great Plains, including surface drainage, aquifer recharge, and wildlife habitat. These small, circular, isolated depressional wetlands with closed watersheds have a dynamic, unpredictable hydroperiod, which is essential to the maintenance of biodiversity. Most numerous in the Southern High Plains of northwestern Texas and eastern New Mexico, playas have been impacted by sedimentation, pit excavation, road construction, industrial and municipal wastewater, feedlot runoff, urban development, overgrazing, and deliberate filling. Despite being declared, as a wetland class, jurisdictional "waters of the United States" since 1977, regulations and laws for conservation of wetland functions have seldom been applied to playas. The January 2001 Supreme Court decision, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. United States Army of Corps of Engineers, likely eliminated federal regulation of impacts covered by the Clean Water Act in all but a few playas. Although still subject to the Federal "Swampbuster" provision enacted by the 1985 Food Security Act, extended natural dry periods allows for frequent cultivation and other activities in playas without incurring violation, contributing to the continued degradation of playa functions. None of the states with significant numbers of playas have regulations for the conservation of playa functions. Suggestions for the successful future conservation of playas and their associated functions include (1) increased promotion and implementation of existing federal and state conservation programs specifically for playas; (2) proposed state regulations for playa conservation; (3) recognition of agricultural impacts on wetland determinations; (4) creation of Welland Management Districts to preserve intact, functioning playas; and (5) increased public education on the value of playas.

TI The SWANCC decision and its implications for prairie potholes

   Dakota; Section 404; South Dakota; Swampbuster
ID NORTH-DAKOTA; DYNAMICS; WETLAND
AB Collectively, the millions of wetlands in the prairie pothole region create one of the most important waterfowl breeding areas in North America. Their use by migratory waterfowl provided a legal rationale, the Migratory Bird Rule, for extending Clean Water Act Section 404 protection to them even though prairie potholes are generally not associated with navigable waters. The U. S. Supreme Court's decision in the case of the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County vs. U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the SWANCC decision, seems to have invalidated the use of the Migratory Bird Rule. We have evaluated the adjacency of potholes to navigable waters and the implications of the SWANCC decision. For most groups of wetland organisms, with the important exception of fish, potholes are not ecologically isolated habitats. Their flora and fauna and functions (primary production, food webs, mineral cycling, water Storage capacity, etc.) are largely determined by water levels, not degree of isolation. Annual changes in precipitation can significantly change their water levels, and this can result in major shifts in their flora and fauna. Hydrologically, prairie potholes are usually connected by ground-water flows and, during wet years, even by surface-water flows. According to landscape analyses done by Ducks Unlimited on selected areas in North and South Dakota, most prairie potholes are not adjacent to (>95%) or even within 1 km (ca. 50%) of navigable waters. Consequently, because of SWANCC, most prairie potholes may no longer be protected under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Most prairie potholes, however, are located on farms and are thus protected by the Swampbuster provision of the 1985 Food Security Act. Even with Swampbuster, there will be minor losses of potholes without any mitigation around cities and towns, and various exemptions under Swampbuster will result in some loss or degradation of prairie potholes. The SWANCC decision, however, will significantly weaken the protection of prairie potholes because it lends strength to existing pressures to weaken or eliminate Swampbuster.

TI Vernal pools and the concept of "isolated wetlands"

DT Article
DE vernal pool; ephemeral wetland; isolated wetland

   DISPERSAL; CALIFORNIA; HABITAT; NORTH; INVERTEBRATES; EVOLUTION; AMERICA
AB Vernal pools, broadly defined as ephemeral wetlands that predictably form in permanent basins during the cooler part of the year but which dry during the summer months, are distributed throughout the world. In the U. S., they are particularly abundant on the Pacific Coast and in various forms in the glaciated landscapes of the north and northeast. Vernal pools are ecosystems that have evolved in a balance between isolation and connectedness. Because of isolation at several scales, the vernal pools biota includes many regionally endemic species. Because of connectedness, vernal pools also share many taxa with continent-spanning distributions at the generic and species level. Vernal pools serve an important local biodiversity function because of their connection to surrounding terrestrial habitats. Along with other ephemeral wetlands, they are the primary habitat for animal species that require relatively predator-free pools for feeding or breeding, including many amphibians. The recent U. S. Supreme Court decision (SWANCC), which deemed "isolated" wetlands to be outside the class of "waters of the United States," places some significant but unknown proportion of vernal pools at risk. In the worst case, the consequences could be immediate reductions in biodiversity at a local level, and regional reductions over longer periods of time. Ideally, federal law should be rewritten to establish unambiguously the value of ephemeral wetlands. It will also be necessary for conservationists to educate the public and to bring the issue of vernal pool protection to the notice of their local and state governments.

AB The term fen has been variously used by peatland ecologists, ground-water hydrologists, and vegetation scientists. The common denominator among all types of fens is recognition of the importance of ground-water discharge, especially mineral-rich ground water, in determining fen hydrology, chemistry, and vegetation, in contrast to wetlands whose characteristics are determined primarily by precipitation or surface-water inputs. Thus, fens tend to occur where climate and hydrogeologic setting sustain flows to the plant-rooting zone of mineral-rich ground water. In the United States, these areas include the glaciated Midwest and Northeast, as well as portions of the Appalachian Mountains and mountainous West. Individually and collectively, fens are among the most floristically diverse of all wetland types, supporting a large number of rare and uncommon bryophytes and vascular plant species, as well as uncommon animals including mammals, reptiles, land snails, butterflies, skippers, and dragonflies. Several species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act inhabit or use fens. Fens also help maintain stream water quality through denitrification and phosphor-us sorption. Few estimates of loss and current extent exist, but where estimates are available, they indicate extensive loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Cultural eutrophication threatens the biological and functional integrity of remaining fens because, along with mineral-rich water, low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus controls many of their distinctive characteristics. Because they occur where ground water discharges to the surface, fens are isolated from neither ground water nor surface water. However, the majority of fens develop in headwater areas and could be defined as "isolated" for jurisdictional purposes because of their distance from navigable-in-fact waters. If so defined, the critical roles that fens play in maintaining biological diversity and stream water quality are at risk regarding federal jurisdiction over "isolated waters" because of the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v.

AB A wetland ecosystem, no matter how small or isolated, includes biotic and abiotic features that interact to promote biodiversity at larger landscape scales. Isolated wetlands, in particular, harbor a significant portion of regional fauna and are often critical habitats for maintaining herpetofaunal biodiversity in southern wetlands. Long-term research on isolated wetlands reveals that two terrestrial habitats contiguous with the wetland-the terrestrial periphery and terrestrial corridors that connect isolated wetlands-are vital for much of the animal community. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the SWANCC decision has severely threatened the continued existence of such wetlands and their associated animals. Recognition that terrestrial habitats associated with isolated wetlands are essential elements for enhancing biodiversity could garner support from regulators, resource managers, and the general public in strengthening wetlands protection.

AB In preparing a major report on geographically isolated wetlands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) initiated a study of the extent of these wetlands across the country. The FWS used geographic information system (GIS) technology to analyze existing digital data (e.g., National Wetlands Inventory data and U.S. Geological Survey hydrologic data) to predict the extent of isolated wetlands in 72 study areas. Study sites included areas where specific types of "isolated" wetlands (e.g., Prairie Pothole marshes, playas, Rainwater Basin marshes and meadows, terminal basins, sinkhole wetlands, Carolina bays, and West Coast vernal pools) were known to occur, as well as areas from other physiographic regions. In total, these sites represented a broad cross-section of America's landscape. Although intended to show examples of the extent of isolated wetlands across the country, the study was not designed to generate statistically significant estimates of isolated wetlands for the nation. As expected, the extent of isolated wetlands was quite variable. The study found that isolated wetlands constituted a significant proportion of the wetland resource in and and semi-arid to subhumid regions and in karst topography. Eight study areas had more than half of their wetland area designated as isolated, while 24 other areas had 20-50 percent of their wetland area in this category. For most sites, isolated wetlands represented a greater percent of the total number of wetlands than the percent of wetland area. This was largely attributed to difference in wetland size, with most non-isolated wetlands being larger than the isolated wetlands. Forty-three sites had more than 50 percent of their total number of wetlands. designated as isolated. The estimates of isolated wetlands presented in this study cannot be readily translated to wetlands that have lost Clean Water Act "protection" based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling for several reasons, including the lack of written guidance on interpreting the Court's decision for identifying jurisdictional wetlands. The results of this GIS analysis present one perspective on the extent of geographically isolated wetlands in the country and represent a starting point for more detailed assessments.

AB On January 9, 2001, the U. S. Supreme Court decision in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) limited the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction by limiting the definition of Waters of the U.S. The Court invalidated the "Migratory Bird Rule" as the sole basis for federal regulation of non-navigable, isolated, and intrastate waters ("isolated wetlands") under the Clean Water Act (CWA). While specifically invalidating the long-standing policy that waters used by migratory birds were included in CWA jurisdiction (termed the migratory bird rule), the decision does not make clear which of the waters and wetlands covered by 33 CFR 328(a)(3) remain under CWA jurisdiction. In January of 2003, the. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published an Advanced Notice for Proposed Rulemaking on CWA Definition of Waters of the United States in the Federal Register. This document requested input from the public as a prelude to rulemaking on behalf of the federal agencies in response to SWANCC. In the absence of clear guidance that can be applied consistently throughout the country, jurisdictional determinations have been left to the individual field offices of the Corps and USEPA and vary widely. Thus, the extent of wetlands and other waters that are impacted as a result of SWANCC still cannot be determined accurately. The potential changes in jurisdiction could alter dramatically the framework for federal-state partnerships in wetlands protection and will require changes in either state or federal programs if protection of aquatic ecosystems is to be sustained at pre-SWANCC levels. The uncertainty over the extent of the change restricts the states' ability to respond. Despite this uncertainty, some states have taken action. Wisconsin passed legislation in the months following the SWANCC decision. Several other states have attempted to make changes through legislation, regulations, and/or guidance with limited success. In half of the states in the U.S., there are no state programs in place or planned to address the reduction in federal jurisdiction. In these states, a significant change in federal regulation could mean the loss of important wetlands.

AB In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC), the U.S. Supreme Court held that isolated, intrastate, non-navigable waters could not be protected under the Clean Water Act based solely on their use by migratory birds. The SWANCC decision has created a need to compile and make available scientific information for post-SWANCC policy development. In response, this article reviews the state of our scientific understanding of isolated wetlands, based on the major findings of papers contributed to this special issue of Wetlands. Because the term "isolated wetland" has not been used consistently in the scientific literature, we recommend that geographically isolated wetlands be defined as "wetlands that are completely surrounded by upland," as proposed by Tiner, for the purposes of scientific studies. Geographically isolated wetlands are not homogeneous but have a broad range of functional response, partly due to their occurrence over a wide range of climatic and geologic settings. One major question addressed through this special issue is the role that isolation plays in the function of geographically isolated wetlands. It appears that isolation is not a primary factor and that many of the functions performed by isolated wetlands are also performed by non-isolated wetlands and non-wetland ecosystems. Variability in moisture conditions plays an important role in the function of many geographically isolated wetlands. However, hydrologic isolation may affect moisture conditions, and biotic isolation could be important for certain populations. Depending on the factor being considered, geographically isolated wetlands are not entirely isolated but are better viewed as occurring within an isolation-connectivity continuum that has both hydrologic and biotic expressions. The juxtaposition of isolation and connectivity occurring in geographically isolated wetlands may represent a semi-isolated state that uniquely shapes these wetlands and their functions. Comprehensive data, designating the number, total area, and functional classification of isolated wetlands, would provide the foundation for monitoring impacts to isolated wetlands. Studies are needed to examine and quantify how isolated wetlands, wetland complexes, and other potentially impacted waters contribute hydrologically, chemically, and biologically to waters of the U.S. Methods to assess and map the degree of connectivity between geographically isolated wetlands and waters of the U.S., based on ground-water travel time, recurrence frequency of intermittent surface-water connections, and home ranges of species that require both types of waters, could be useful for regulators. Whatever policies are developed, scientific input and technical information will continue to play a crucial role in the policy and regulatory arena. Maintaining and enhancing the dialogue among wetland scientists, policy-makers, and regulators will ensure that critical information is developed and communicated and also continue to invigorate wetland science.

AB Foraging activity by snow geese (Chen caerulescens) often creates large areas devoid of vegetation ("eat-outs") in moist-soil impoundments and coastal wetlands. Open-water habitats that result from eat-outs may be valuable foraging areas for other wetland-dependent birds (i.e., waterfowl and shorebirds). However, few studies. have examined the effects of goose-induced habitat changes on invertebrates, an important food source for both waterfowl and shorebirds. We quantified changes in abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates in response to snow goose herbivory in moist-soil impoundments at Prime Hook-National Wildlife Refuge, Delaware, USA. We found invertebrate taxon richness and diversity and abundance of Chironomidae, Coleoptera, and Total Invertebrates to be higher in goose-excluded sites than in adjacent eat-outs. These effects were most pronounced during January, February, and early April. We Also measured invertebrate abundance in shorebird exclosures in eat-outs but found few detectable effects of shorebird predation on invertebrates. Our study demonstrated that abundant snow geese may negatively influence availability of invertebrates for other nonbreeding waterbirds, suggesting that management actions to reduce-local goose populations or deter feeding in impoundments may be warranted.

AB Coastal wetland loss is a major environmental issue in the Mississippi Delta region of the southern United States, where grasses such as Spartina alterniflora may play a critical role both as early colonizers on created sites and as facilitators of other marsh grasses and shrubs, particularly at high intertidal elevations. We explored the potential role of S. alterniflora as a facilitator of the colonization and growth of the shrub Baccharis halimifolia at two created wetlands in southwestern Louisiana through a combination of plant surveys and experimentation. Surveys for the presence of B. halimifolia inside and outside the bare centers of S. alterniflora clones that had begun to senesce inwardly were conducted at a 4-yr-old site originally created in 1993. The percent of clones containing B. halimifolia and the number of individual B. halimifolia plants per clone increased with increasing S. alterniflora clone size and decreased with increasing distance from an adjacent containment berm. Two experiments conducted at a second 4-yr-old site that was originally created in 1996 were designed to assess seed capture and growth of seedlings of B. halimifolia inside S. alterniflora clones. These experiments revealed that while significantly fewer seeds settle inside clones, those seedlings that grow in such areas gain a clear advantage in terms of both survival and rate of growth, which helps to explain the results of the initial survey and testifies to the role of S. alterniflora as a nurse plant in newly-created high intertidal marshes.

AB The regulation and management of wetlands is often contentious because wetlands share characteristics of both land, typically a private good, and water, typically treated as a public good. Landowners' desires to develop "their property" with wetlands tend to conflict with the public benefits associated with healthy, intact wetland ecosystems. To understand better how residents in the state of Michigan, USA understand and perceive wetlands, a statewide telephone survey was undertaken. The survey of 1012 Michigan residents revealed most people to be very familiar with wetlands and think it very important to protect them. Across demographic groups, at least 60 percent of respondents believe it to be very important that wetlands exist both now and in the future. Multiple regression analysis suggests that younger, better educated, and wealthier people place greater importance than others on wetland existence; the analysis also indicates that Republicans seem to value wetlands slightly less than Democrats and Independents. Interestingly, respondents' community type (e.g., rural, urban, suburban) appears to make relatively little difference on the importance of wetland existence.

AB Although regulatory agencies in the USA typically require 3-5 yr of post-restoration monitoring of biotic responses to wetland mitigation, many researchers have argued that longer time frames are needed to assess population responses adequately. We conducted an 8-yr study to examine the demographic responses of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) to wetland creation at a mitigation bank in western North Carolina. Our primary goals were to compare juvenile output in ten reference and ten constructed ponds and to assess the overall change in breeding population size in response to site restoration. We used annual censuses of egg masses to assess changes in breeding population size and used estimates of larval population size at hatching and the initiation of metamorphosis to assess embryonic and larval survival. Adults of both species bred in most constructed ponds within a few months after filling in 1996. Estimated juvenile production from 1996 to 2002 did not differ significantly between pond types for either species. The percentage of both constructed and reference ponds that produced juveniles decreased markedly from 1996 to 1998 and remained low through 2002. The decrease in juvenile output was mostly associated with reduced larval survival rather than, increased embryonic mortality across years. Drought and outbreaks of a pathogen (Ranavirus) were the primary causes of low juvenile production from 1998 to 2002. The overall breeding population of R. sylvatica increased markedly in 1999-2000 following a large recruitment of juveniles from constructed ponds in 1996-1997. With the onset of drought and ranaviral infections, the population declined to levels in 2002 that were at or below 1995 pre-restoration numbers. Despite site perturbations, the breeding population of A. maculatum remained relatively stable from 1995 to 2002, a phenomenon that may reflect selection for delayed reproduction and iteroparity in this species. Although we have monitored R. sylvatica and A. maculatum for seven breeding seasons after the creation of seasonal wetlands, we are still uncertain that site restoration will achieve the goal of increasing breeding populations above pre-restoration levels. Because amphibians have significant population lags and are sensitive to site perturbations, monitoring that exceeds five years may be required to assess demographic responses to site restoration adequately.

AB Patchy wetlands are commonly found in the polar desert at localities where ample water supply is available during the thawed season. These wetlands can occur on a wide range of topography, and they support more luxuriant vegetation than their surrounding areas. Snowbank wetlands are characterized by a zonation of vegetation, with increasingly rich plant coverage away from the snowbed edge. Ground-water wetlands usually occupy topographic concavities or depressions, with exfiltration of subsurface water to sustain a high water table and to provide an enrichment of nutrients. Riverine wetlands experience prolonged flooding during the peak snowmelt season, and their vascular plant cover is low owing to inundation by the cold, turbulent stream water. Lakes and ponds are associated with topographic depressions, receiving surface- and ground-water inputs from catchment areas larger than the surface extent of the water bodies. Their evaporation rates are high, but the open water season is curtailed by ice cover. Lake outflow wetlands are supported by spillage and seepage from lakes, and they maintain a relatively lush vegetation cover. Coastal wetlands form narrow strips enclosed by raised beaches, with high salinity that limits plant diversity. Strong interactions exist among the water and heat fluxes to the wetland, the vegetation, and the hydrogeomorphology. Locally enhanced water supply and shallow permafrost enable frequent saturation, augmenting nutrient enrichment and encouraging vegetation development. Slow vegetation decay in a cold environment facilitates the formation of peat. The saturated soil conditions give rise to large ground-ice content in the winter, requiring much latent heat for ground thaw in subsequent summers. This, together with the insulating properties of the organic layer, creates shallow frost tables during the summer and produces a positive feedback that maintains high water tables in the wetlands to favor plant growth.

AB The initial stages of seed-bank and vegetation development were documented in a newly created tidal freshwater wetland where donor soils were not applied. The 32.3-ha site adjacent to the Delaware River in New Jersey, USA was completed in stages from November 1993 to November 1994. Objectives of the study were to determine characteristics of the seed bank and vegetation and to monitor spatial and temporal changes. The study was carried out from 1995 to 1999 using three sites (North, East, and South Marshes) and three elevation locations (1 m from a tidal channel, midpoint, and 1 m from the upland edge). Development of the seed bank and vegetation demonstrated tremendous colonization potential derived from regional and local sources. Colonization and complete plant cover occurred within one year, and subsequent changes were rapid. Individual species behaved uniquely regarding colonization time, duration, and decline in both the seed bank and vegetation. Large seed banks of some species were present even after decline in the vegetation. Overall, the seed bank was large, small-seeded and persistent, and diverse. A total of 177 species occurred in soil seed bank and 92 in field vegetation samples, with 72 contributing to cover. Seed-bank densities (mean +/- SE/m(2)) ranged from 450 +/- 152 to 394,600 +/- 29,950. Species richness (species/ sainple) ranged from 3.3 +/- 1.2 to 32.3 +/- 1.8. Density and species richness were clearly reduced by inundation and were lowest in channel edge samples and in the first year (1995). Cover species richness ranged from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 per quadrat. Complexity of the vegetation increased over time, with lowest diversity along the channels. The 1995 site differences, with greatest densities and species richness in the East Marsh, could be related to site history (timing of construction). Species similarity between the seed bank and vegetation ranged from 11 to 53 % and showed no site, location, or temporal pattern. However, similarity between sites of the seed bank and vegetation increased from 1995 to 1998. Several New Jersey State rare or threatened species, as well as invasive species, were present. Results indicated that it is ecologically feasible to create a wetland adjacent to a tidal freshwater river without use of donor soil and that transplantation had not been necessary.

AB The use of dredge material is a well-known technique for creating or restoring salt marshes that is expected to become more common along the Gulf of Mexico coast in the future. However, the effectiveness of this restoration method is still questioned. Wetland structural characteristics were compared between four created and three natural salt marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA. The created marshes, formed by the pumping of dredge material into formerly open water areas, represent a chronosequence, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years. Vegetation and soil structural factors were compared to determine whether the created marshes become more similar over time to the natural salt marshes. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2002 using the line-intercept technique.,Site elevations were measured in 2000. Organic matter (OM) was measured in 1996 and 2002, while bulk density and soil particle-size distribution were determined in 2002 only. The natural marshes were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, as were the oldest created marshes; these marshes had the lowest mean site elevations (< 30 cm NGVD). The six-year-old created marsh (formed in 1996) was higher in elevation (> 35 cm NGVD) and became dominated by high marsh (S. patens, Distichlis spicata) and shrub (Baccharis halimifolia, Iva frutescens) species. The higher elevation marsh seems to be following a different plant successional trajectory than the other marshes, indicating a relationship between marsh elevation and species composition. The soils in both the created and natural marshes contain high levels of clays (30-65 %), with sand comprising < 1 % of the soil distribution. OM was significantly greater and bulk density significantly lower in two of the natural marshes when compared to the created marshes. The oldest created marsh had significantly greater OM than the younger created marshes, but it may still take several decades before equivalency is reached with the natural marshes. Vegetation structural characteristics in the created marshes take only a few years to become similar to those in the natural marshes, just so long as the marshes are formed at a proper elevation. This agrees with other studies from North Carolina and Texas. However, it will take several decades for the soil characteristics to reach equivalency with the natural marshes, if they ever will.

AB This study investigated the distribution and determinants of marsh vegetation along the major distributary channel system of southern Africa's largest wetland, the Okavango Delta, using a large, interdisciplinary data set. Eight communities were recognized, dominated respectively by Pennisetum glaucocladum, Phragmites mauritianus, Cyperus papyrus, Cyperus papyrus/Miscanthus junceus, Miscanthus junceus, Imperata cylindrica, Pycreus nitidus and a mixed bog community. The Pennisetum glaucocladum community is situated in the Panhandle (a narrow valley reach at the head of the fan) on elevated scroll bars that are flooded seasonally for short periods (days to weeks). The Phragmites mauritianus community occurs largely in the Panhandle where channel margins have high clay contents and where soils are seasonally flooded for moderate periods (months). Fires are widespread in the Panhandle, but both Pennisetum glaucocladum and Phragmites mauritianus are stoloniferous, and meristems occur below the soil surface and are protected from fire. In contrast, the rhizomatous sedge C papyrus dominates in situations where meristems are permanently submerged, and therefore protected from fire, such as areas of open channel water where current velocities are sufficiently low to enable the extension of C. papyrus into the channel. This situation exists where channel avulsion has recently taken place or where discharge is reduced by water loss from the channel by overspill. The semi-floating habit of C. papyrus in the channel fringe results in high hydraulic conductivities, which promotes water loss from channels and leads to sediment deposition within channels. Miscanthus junceus occurs in areas where the nutrient status of water is low, seasonal changes in water level are small,. and the average water level is approximately constant over decadal time scales. It occurs some distance from the-channel on the upper reaches of the Delta and progressively closer to the channel downstream such that. it is the dominant channel fringe species in the distal reaches.. This pattern, where a community occurs progressively closer-to the channel downstream is similar for communities dominated by Imperata cylindrica and Pycreus nitidus suggesting that environmental gradients (probably nutrient supply) perpendicular to-the channel axis are steep and that they am mirrored by long-range environmental gradients downstream. An analysis of hydraulic characteristics of this distributary river system illustrates that channel width varies most with variation in discharge, while channel depth and current velocity are relatively constant over the range of discharges in the study area. Since channel width, is primarily a consequence of vegetation processes in the channel margin, especially the growth of the giant sedge C papyrus it is clear that channel hydraulics are affected largely by vegetation.

AB A tissue culture and plant regeneration protocol for the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, has been developed. Callus was efficiently induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 mg L-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 1 mg L-1 indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Callus initiation from 6-day-old seedlings was faster and occurred with a greater frequency than callus initiation from coleoptile-covered segments from the same age seedlings. However, only the coleoptile-covered segments produced regenerable callus, which was maintained on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L-1 2,4-D and 1 mg L-1 naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The regenerable callus differentiated into shoots upon transfer to shoot regeneration medium. A high frequency of shoot regeneration was obtained when the medium contained 3 mg L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) or Thidiazuron (TDZ), with or without the addition of 0.2 mg L-1 lAA. Regenerated shoots were transferred to root regeneration medium, the optimal of which was determined to be half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L-1 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). TDZ in the shoot regeneration medium inhibited root formation in the root regeneration medium, making BA rather than TDZ the optimal hormone for the shoot regeneration medium. The mode of plant regeneration was organogenesis. Upon transfer to soil, the most successful growth of plants occurred in a mixture of commercially available potting soil and natural marsh mud. The development of a tissue culture and regeneration protocol for S. alterniflora provides the possibility of selecting lines of this species, via somaclonal variation, with characteristics desirable for wetland creation and restoration.

ID PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; GERMINATION; GROWTH
AB Alnus maritima (seaside alder) occurs in wet or flooded soils on the Delmarva Peninsula (southern Delaware and adjacent counties of eastern Maryland, USA) and in small niches in Georgia and Oklahoma. Although some A. maritima exist in coastal estuaries, responses of the species to salt, and whether salt resistance depends on provenance of plant origin, are not known. We first compared salt injury among A. maritima from all provenances irrigated with dilutions of ocean water. Seedlings from the three provenances responded similarly. Salinity up to 3.1 g/kg did not alter stem elongation but did cause increases in the ratio of dry to fresh weight of basipetal leaves, which reflected their necrosis. Photosynthesis and growth after treatment with salt then were compared among A. maritima and four other woody species: Baccharis halimifolia, Ceanothus americanus, Myrica cerifera, and Cornus amomum. Irrigation solutions with up to 12 g/kg salinity had no effect on B. halimifolia and caused no visible damage to M. cerifera. Ceanothus americanus showed foliar necrosis and decreases in photosynthesis at 3, 6, and 12 g/kg. Photosynthesis of A. maritima and C. amomum was sustained after irrigating with solutions at 3 g/kg but was reduced by 6 and 12 g/kg salinity. Our third experiment showed a more pronounced decrease in photosynthesis as salinity increased for A. maritima with roots partially or totally inundated in solutions with salt compared to plants irrigated but not inundated with these solutions. Lastly, symptoms of salt injury among A. maritima planted at locations that differed in salinity along the Broadkill River, an estuary in Delaware, were found to be similar to those we documented among plants treated in a greenhouse. We conclude that necrosis of basipetal leaves is the most apparent symptom of injury caused by salt in the root zones of A. maritima, that low concentrations of salt can lead to damage, and that the rate at which symptoms develop in this riparian species varies with the extent of root-zone inundation with salt water. Alnus maritima was less sensitive than C. americanus to salt but was considerably more sensitive than B. halimifolia and M. cerifera.

ID PRAIRIE WETLANDS; PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS; INVERTEBRATES; GROWTH; FISH
AB Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America are harsh environments for fish, and only two planktivorous species are common in these ecosystems: fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans). Given their similarities, competition between these species may be high, especially for food resources. We assessed potential competition between fathead minnows and brook sticklebacks, as well as their influence on zooplankton communities, by measuring their selectivity for zooplankton prey in controlled laboratory experiments. Minnows and sticklebacks of varying size were placed in aquaria with mixed zooplankton assemblages to assess selectivity for copepod and Daphnia prey. Sticklebacks of all sizes showed strong selectivity for Daphnia, while minnows were less selective, and prey selectivity varied with fish size. Selectivity of prey was not related to relative prey abundance for either minnows or sticklebacks. Although minnows were less selective, their mass-specific consumption rates were significantly lower than consumption rates for sticklebacks. Our results indicated that effects of predation on zooplankton may differ between these two fish species, with minnows potentially affecting greater numbers of taxa. Additionally, generalist feeding on zooplankton prey by fathead minnows may be advantageous in habitats with low Daphnia densities, as is common in prairie wetlands with dense fish populations.

AB A 9.9-ha constructed wetland designed to reduce nitrogen in municipal wastewater following conventional secondary treatment began operating in southern California's San Jacinto Valley in September 1994. The wetland incorporated zones of bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus and S. californicus) for effluent treatment, plus areas of 1.8-m deep open water and other features to benefit wintering waterfowl. A one-year long program to monitor bird use and evaluate their contribution to loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus was initiated seven months later and a second, four-month long period of monitoring was initiated after a 20-month hiatus. Daily bird use peaked at nearly 12,000 individuals during the second period. Estimates of maximum daily nitrogen and phosphorus input by birds were 139 g N ha(-1) day(-1) and 56 g P ha(-1) day(-1). Following a reconfiguration of the wetland that increased the area of open water, a third year-long period of monitoring was initiated in September 2000. Estimated maximum daily loading attributable to birds during this period reached 312 g N ha(-1) day(-1) and 124 g P ha(-1) day(-1). These levels represent only 2.6% and 7.0%, respectively, of the mean daily loads of N and P in inflow water from the wastewater-treatment plant. Wintering waterfowl contributed the most to nutrient loading, but the numerically dominant species was the colonial Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). The wetland's nutrient-removal efficiency was negatively correlated to bird loading. However, the greatest bird loading occurred during November to March, when winter conditions would reduce microbial nutrient-removal processes and plant uptake in the wetland. Multiple regression analysis indicated that variation in nutrient removal efficiency over a one-year period was best explained by wetland water temperature (R-2 = 0.21) and that little additional insight was gained by adding bird loading and inflow nutrient load data (R-2 = 0.22). This case study supports the concept that a constructed wetland can be designed both to reduce nutrients in municipal wastewater and to provide habitat for wetland birds.

AB Data acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) with 224 bands, each with 0.01-mum spectral resolution and 20-meter spatial resolution, were used to produce a vegetation map for a portion of Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. The vegetation map was tested for classification accuracy with a pre-existing detailed GIS wetland vegetation database compiled by manual interpretation of 1:40,000-scale color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs. Although the accuracy varied greatly for different classes, ranging from 40 percent for scrub red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) to 100 percent for spike rush (Eleocharis cellulosa) prairies, the Everglades communities generally were successfully identified, averaging 66 percent correct for all classes. In addition, the hyperspectral image data proved suitable for detecting the invasive exotic species lather leaf (Colubrina asiatica) that is sometimes difficult to differentiate on aerial photographs. The findings from this study have implications for operational uses of spaceborne hyperspectral image data that are now becoming available. Practical limitations of using such image data for wetland vegetation mapping include inadequate spatial resolution, complexity of image processing procedures, and lack of stereo viewing.

AB Hundreds of wetlands comprising thousands of hectares have been restored in the Midwestern United States. In nearly all cases, restoration consisted of simply restoring wetland hydrology. For this reason, the success of these restorations relies on natural colonization. We compared the structure and composition of the vegetation in two types of wetlands: 10 natural wetlands and 17 five-to-seven-year-old restored wetlands. The overall vegetative composition of restored wetlands was different from that of natural wetlands. Restored wetland flora was formed from a subset of species found in natural wetlands. The species restricted to natural wetlands tended to be native perennials and were evenly represented along the elevational gradient. The few species that were restricted to restored wetlands were largely mudflat annuals whose presence is more indicative of the presence of more unvegetated habitat in restored wetlands than of the presence of a distinctive restored wetlands flora. In addition, restored wetlands had lower vegetative cover and species richness than natural wetlands. Both wetland types had similar numbers of exotic species at the whole wetland (4.4 species per wetland) and quadrat scale (1.5 species m(2)), and dominance of exotics increased with elevation. The lower species richness, greater compositional variability, and lack of a distinctive flora support the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is the primary cause of the differences between the vegetation in restored and natural wetlands.

ID NORTH-DAKOTA; ISOLATED WETLANDS; USA; REGION
AB A number of studies have noted the occurrence of intermittent surface-water connections between depressional wetlands in general and prairie potholes in particular. Yet, the ecological implications of such connections remain largely unexplored. In 1995, we observed spillage into and out of a North Dakota wetland during two field visits. Between May 3 and May 26, there was a positive relationship between specific conductance and water level at this site, suggesting an external source of dissolved ions. We estimated that specific conductance may have increased at the site by as much as 614 muS cm(-1) due to spillage from the upslope wetland. Based on a spatial analysis that compared National Wetlands Inventory maps with 1996 color infrared imagery, we estimated that 28% of the area's wetlands had a temporary surface water connection to at least one other wetland at that time, including one complex of 14 interconnected wetlands. These results indicate that the connectivity observed in 1995 was not confined to the two wetlands nor to that single year. The degree of connectivity we observed would be expected to occur during the wetter portions of the region's 20-year wet-dry cycle. We hypothesize that intermittent surface-water connections between wetlands occur throughout the prairie pothole region. Given patterns in relief and precipitation, these connections most likely would have occurred in the eastern portion of the prairie pothole region. However, wetland drainage may have altered historical patterns. The implication of these spatial and temporal trends is that surface-water connections between depressional wetlands should be viewed as a probability event that has some distribution over time and space. We refer to connections that are impermanent, temporally discontinuous, or sporadic as temporal connectivity. The most intriguing feature of these temporary connections may be that they could affect biodiversity or population dynamics through transport of individuals or reproductive bodies. Research is needed to determine whether these connections actually cause these biological effects and to characterize the distribution and effects of this phenomenon.

AB Intensive agricultural activities near prairie wetlands may result in excessive sediment loads, which may bury seed and invertebrate egg banks that are important for maintenance and cycling of biotic communities during wet/dry cycles. We evaluated effects of sediment burial on emergence of plants and invertebrates from seed and invertebrate egg banks. Sediment-load experiments indicated that burial depths of 0.5 cm caused a 91.7% reduction in total seedling emergence and a 99.7% reduction in total invertebrate emergence. Results of our burial experiments corroborated prior research on seedling emergence. However, our study demonstrated that invertebrate emergence is also highly susceptible to the effects of burial. Our research suggests that sediment entering wetlands from agricultural erosion may also hamper successional changes throughout interannual climate cycles. Land-management strategies need to be implemented that will prevent erosion of cropland top soil from entering wetlands.

AB Productivity is an important ecological function of any. natural system and may be quite high in wetlands. Restoration of productive wetlands may play a key role in re-establishing ecological function to portions of the vast areas of wetlands (roughly 86%) drained and otherwise altered in the United States over the past two centuries. A restored wetland at the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge (upstate New-York,, USA) was examined to determine if ecological function (i.e., productivity), as well as biotic structure, was restored. Physicochemical conditions and both aquatic and terrestrial productivity were measured at the restoration site-and compared with rates and conditions in a reference wetland. Gross aquatic community production rates (based on diurnal oxygen curves) were similar at each site (1,679 and 2,311 g O-2.m(-2).yr(-1)) and within the range-expected for the habitat. Terrestrial Net Aboveground Primary Production rates (measured by monthly biomass changes) (2,400 and 2,500 g dry wt. . m(-2) . yr(-1)) were also similar between sites when tree and herb production were combined. Aquatic respiration rates (3,704 and 4,552 g O-2 . m(-2) yr(-1) were also similar but high, typically more than twice as large as gross aquatic production. As a result, net aquatic production rates at both sites were usually negative, indicating that these small wetlands are organic matter sinks that satisfy aquatic respiration by consumption of both autochthonous aquatic production and imported terrestrial production. They enhance diversity of the local landscape by producing populations of aquatic consumers that cannot be supported by aquatic production alone. Typical Weiland conditions and processes developed quickly after restoration, but differences in biotic community structure indicate that observed rates of production and respiration at both sites were maintained by flow through different food-web pathways. Despite the relatively high process rates, any successional progress of the restoration site is expected-to be slow.

TI Historical wetlands in Oregon's Willamette Valley: Implications for

AB Before agricultural expansion in the 19(th) century, river valleys of North America supported expanses of wetland habitat. In restoring these landscapes, it is important to understand their historical condition and biological function. Synthesizing historical primary accounts (from explorers, travelers, settlers, and farmers)with contemporary knowledge of these wetland systems, we developed a profile of the wetlands and their use by nonbreeding waterbirds (e.g., waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds) within the Willamette Valley, Oregon, ca. 1840. We found evidence for three types of wetlands used by non-breeding waterbirds in fall, winter, and spring: emergent wetlands, riverine wetlands, and wetland prairie. The most extensive wetland type was wetland prairie, which functioned as fall/winter habitat for waterbirds, but only while native Kalapuyans managed the region with fire. Since the mid-1800s, four species, in particular, have decreased their use of the Willamette Valley: trumpeter-swan (Cygnus buccinator), snow goose (Chen caerulescens), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), and long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus). Information suggests that ca. 1840, waterbirds and their habitats were more abundant in the Willamette Valley than today. Restoration of the Willamette Valley landscape is warranted, and today's agricultural wetlands-former wetland prairie-hold highest restoration potential.

ID COMPENSATORY MITIGATION
AB We characterized wetland mitigation projects at 50 randomly selected sites across Tennessee, USA. Mitigation in the form of creation, restoration, enhancement, and preservation was used to replace the 38 ha of jurisdictional wetlands destroyed. Over 104 ha of compensatory wetland mitigation were proposed for this loss; however, only 77.7 ha were present when each of the sites was delineated. A large percentage of the mitigation area (61%) was in the form of preservation and enhancement of existing wetlands. The majority of sites (72%) contained less area than was stipulated in the permit. Poor design resulting in improper hydrology and poor survival of planted stock was likely the primary cause of this reduced area. Wetland mitigation efforts in Tennessee likely could be improved if greater emphasis was placed on design of the project, especially with regard to the hydrology of the site.

ID AMPHIBIANS; WETLANDS; LANDSCAPE; FORESTS
AB Vernal pools in northeastern North America are typically seasonal woodland pools that support breeding populations of amphibians and invertebrates dependent upon fishless environments for successful reproduction. A survey of 304 vernal pools in southern, central, and northern Maine, USA was conducted to assess pool physical characteristics, landscape setting, and presence of pool-breeding amphibians for the purpose of guiding potential pool conservation strategies. In particular, information on reproductive effort by pool-breeding amphibians was used to assess the statewide applicability of the Maine Natural Resources Protection Act's proposed definition of Significant Vernal Pool, a category of Significant Wildlife Habitats that allows closer environmental review of proposed impacts to vernal pools. The results of our study show regional differences in pool characteristics and amphibian usage. Defining "significance" based on number of egg masses and diversity of vernal pool indicator species is a useful tool but should be considered in the context of such landscape characteristics as availability of suitable terrestrial habitat and distribution of other breeding habitats and wetlands.

TI Inventory and characterization of wetland habitat on the Winnebago Upper
   Pool Lakes, Wisconsin, USA: An integrated multimedia-GIS approach
SO WETLANDS

ID DATABASE
AB An integrated, multimedia-geographic information system (GIS) approach to inventorying and characterizing thirty-nine wetland sites identified on the Winnebago Upper Pool Lakes in Wisconsin, USA was developed. Available black-and-white aerial photographs recorded in 1937, 1957, and 1981 and color digital orthophotos of 2000 were employed as primary data sources to develop a spatio-temporal GIS database using a combination of digital image processing, GIS, Global Positioning System (GPS), and field survey techniques. Ten representative sites were selected to investigate the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the wetland habitat in the study area further. Multimedia information as text, graphics, ground photographs, and digital video was then developed to highlight the ecosystem function and structure of those representative wetlands. A computer-based interactive multimedia system, consisting of a graphical user interface and a GIS application module, was constructed to allow easy access to both the spatial data sets and the multimedia information. Given the increased concern over environmental preservation, expansion of urban development, and agricultural land use, it is anticipated that the database will prove valuable for a series of management tasks. The integrated approach provides an innovative way for integrating, analyzing, and presenting wetland information, thus enabling truly interactive collaborations among resource managers, policy makers, researchers, and stakeholders.

AB The Clear Lake watershed, California, USA has been modified for agriculture since the arrival of Europeans in the early 1800s, and this has led to the deterioration of lake water quality. To assess the response of Clear Lake wetland sediments to recent environmental changes caused by watershed modification, physical and chemical properties of sediment cores at the inlet (Rodman Slough) and outlet (Anderson Marsh) were analyzed. Pb-210 dating showed increases of sedimentation rate for Anderson Marsh in the 1930s and 1980s, and those increases corresponded to algal blooms and the increase of P input into Clear Lake, respectively. Ranges of recent sedimentation and mass accumulation rates in Anderson Marsh were 0.41-0.52 cm/yr and 1070-1380 g m(-2) yr(-1). Accumulation rates-of P, Cal Mg, K, and Pb were slightly higher in Rodman Slough than in Anderson Marsh. Sediment analyses showed that the excess P originating from agricultural activities reach Clear Lake through Rodman Slough and were removed in the lake.

AB To evaluate the potential development of a macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Prairie Pothole Region wetlands, we sampled the aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish communities in 24 semipermanent wetlands located throughout central North Dakota. Wetland basins were selected to encompass a range of surrounding land-use, ranging from 100% grassland to 100% cropland. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the influences of fish, and temporal and spatial variation on the macroinvertebrate community. We also used RDA to look for relationships between wetland macroinvertebrate communities and land-use. Seventeen potential invertebrate metrics were tested by graphical analyses. We identified a strong influence on the macroinvertebrate community due to the presence of fish. A number of invertebrate taxa decreased in abundance as the summer progressed, and there was noticeable variation in the invertebrate community among individual wetlands of the region. However, we detected no strong relationships between the varying degrees of agricultural land-use in the wetland catchments and the invertebrate community. Consequently, we were unable to identify any effective IBI metrics indicative of land-use disturbance. Lack of correspondence between land-use and macroinvertebrates in this habitat is most likely due to a high degree of natural disturbance (e.g., presence of fish, temporal changes) and a low diversity community of resilient taxa in Prairie Pothole Region wetlands.

ID ANNUAL DORMANCY CYCLE
AB The recovery plan for the U.S. federally endangered Xyris tennesseensis calls for increasing the size of some existing populations and establishing new ones in suitable sites. As a contribution to this goal, we investigated seed dormancy and germination and attempted to propagate the species in non-native soil. Freshly matured seeds were conditionally dormant and germinated to 0, 0, 92, 91, and 74% in light after two weeks at 15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/15, and 35/20degreesC, respectively. Seeds retained the ability to germinate to 80-100% in light at 25/15 and at 30/15degreesC throughout a 39.5-month period of burial in an unheated greenhouse. Following the first year of burial, however, germination at 20/10degreesC showed an annual cycle, with 79-86% of the seeds germinating in spring but only 0-1% in autumn. Under natural temperature regimes, seeds sown on native soil germinated from mid-May to early August. Seeds had an absolute light requirement for germination, and those incubated at 30/15degreesC required six days of light (14-hour daily photoperiod) to subsequently germinate in darkness. The species has a small persistent soil seed bank. Although no dormancy-breaking treatments are required for seeds to germinate to high percentages in light at high temperatures, growing seedlings/juveniles in non-native soil is very difficult. Seeds germinated during summer when sown on both inorganic and black organic soils, with and without the addition of lime, but few seedlings lived for more than one month. Only two of 125 juveniles lived for two months after they were transplanted from native soil into black organic soil. One strategy to increase the number of plants at a site may be to remove litter and sow seeds on the surface of undisturbed soil in late spring-summer.

AB Wetland basins in the Prairie Pothole Region of the U.S. are commonly modified by excavation (e.g., roadside ditches, stock dugouts), partial drainage (ditching), and diking. Differences in the distribution of modified wetlands may affect the predictive accuracy of waterfowl survey data if such wetlands are not distributed randomly in the landscape and if waterfowl are not distributed equally among them. We used data collected on thirty-eight 40-km(2) plots in North Dakota to examine the distribution of modified basins relative to roadside transects and their use by five species of dabbling ducks in 1995. The 800-m-wide transects were subdivided into an inner 400-m transect, centered on the road, and the remaining outer transect area. We compared the distribution of modified and natural wetland basins among three sample areas: 1) the inner 400-m-wide roadside transect area, 2) the outer transect area, and 3) the remaining area within the 40-km(2) plot that was outside of the transects (outer plot). Duck use was compared between the two transect areas. The plots contained 20,582 basins, of which 88.5% were unmodified, 7.5% were excavated, 3.7% were partially drained, and 0.2% were diked. Nearly all excavated temporary (89%) and seasonal (90%) basins occurred in the inner transect area, reflecting the high proportion of basins that would be defined as roadside ditches. Excavated semipermanent basins were more evenly distributed among the outer plot and two transect widths; these basins often were dugouts but also included roadside ditches. Partially drained and diked basins also were fairly evenly distributed among the three sample areas. Semipermanent basins had greater use by mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintails (A. acuta) when they were partially drained than when they were excavated or unmodified; pintails also had greater use of partially drained seasonal basins. Use of wetland basins by gadwall (A. strepera), blue-winged teal (A. discors), and northern shovelers (A. clypeata) did not differ among water regimes or modification. We found no evidence to indicate that duck numbers determined from standard 400-m-wide roadside transects were biased relative to the larger landscape. However, pond counts derived from such transects were biased. Correlations of duck numbers to pond counts that exclude ditches or temporary basins would poorly reflect the response of ducks to available water.

AB Preserving biodiversity implies the development of indicators to evaluate management practices and to identify critical thresholds and dynamics that modify ecosystems. This study was conducted in the Camargue Delta (South of France). Mediterranean wetlands represent great potential for biodiversity, and their natural dynamics are strongly influenced by water control. We hypothesized that human influence can be estimated by taking into account spatial patterns of human artifacts. We defined two types of landscape indicators of human pressure: the spatial density and the connectivity of the hydrologic network. Co-inertia analysis was used to explore the correlation between these indicators and aquatic macrophyte communities sampled in marshes. Results suggested that human action may strongly influence marsh aquatic macrophyte communities and affect ecological dynamics. Particularly, alteration of wetland integrity by water control may promote the replacement of specialized species by generalist and exotic species. The canal network seems to facilitate dispersion of Ludwigia peploides between marshes. This result confirmed the negative role of corridors in facilitating dispersion of exotic species from one patch to another. We found positive correlations between landscape indicators and macrophyte composition, which is consistent with the tested hypothesis. The density of hydraulic structure was revealed to be a relevant landscape predictor of marsh biological state.

AB Seagrasses in shallow sheltered regions of estuarine, brackish, and marine environments are of productive and ecological importance. The major seagrass meadows in India exist along the southeast coast (Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay) and in the lagoons of islands from Lakshadweep (Arabian sea) and Andaman and Nicobar (Bay of Bengal). The flora comprises 15 species and is dominated by Cymodocea rotundata, C serrulata, Thalassia hemprichii, Halodule uninervis, H. pinifolia, Halophila beccarii, H. ovata, and H. ovalis. Distribution occurs from the intertidal zone to a maximum depth of similar to15 m. Maximum growth and biomass are restricted from the lower littoral zone to the depth of 2-2.5 m. A significant correlation (r = -0.63 and -0.71, respectively, p < 0.05) was observed between depth and biomass from major seagrass meadows. Greatest species richness and biomass of seagrass occur mainly in open marine sandy habitats. Associated and epiphytic floras mainly consist of marine algae and are dominated by members of the rhodophyceae group. Various fishes, molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms form the predominant associated fauna. Macrofauna mainly comprised of Oligochaetes (40.17%), Polychaetes (18.96%), Crustaceans (11.36%), and Nematods (18.71%), while meiofaunal groups mainly consisted of Turbellaria (34.17%), Nematoda (37.3%), and Harpacticoida (10.11%). In India, seagrass habitat, although categorized under ecologically sensitive coastal areas, is largely ignored from the educational, research, and management points of views. In spite of being one of the predominant marine macrophytic floras, surprisingly, seagrasses have not been introduced in plant science studies, even at the university level. Unawareness regarding the functions of seagrasses at an educational level and among the common people and coastal zone managers has resulted in enormous damage to them in the recent past. Seagrass habitat is under constantly increasing threat from various anthropogenic activities. Strict implementation of a Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) act is imperative to check further deterioration of seagrass beds.

AB Shallow depressions found in karst terrains may contain wetlands (karst pans) that fluctuate seasonally in response to climatic conditions. This study examined the ground-water hydrology of a chain of 17 wetlands, ranging in size from 0.06 to 0.4 hectares, located in an Appalachian karst valley in central Pennsylvania, USA. The study objective was to determine the contributing area of wetland source waters. A variety of hydraulic head, soil stratigraphy, and water chemistry-data indicate that the combined contributing areas of these wetland ponds extend to a maximum distance of approximately 150 in from the ponds. The hydrologic catchment area of the ponds during January and February, 1999 (approximately 2-8 hectares) was significantly smaller than catchment area based on topography (69 hectares). The water source of the wetlands consists of direct precipitation inputs and shallow (0.5-6 m) perched ground water. The hydrologic catchment area of the ponds expands during wet periods and contracts during dry periods. The ponds have been shown to be perched above the regional water table.

TI The role of a floodplain in regulating aquifer recharge during a flood
   event of the River Adour in southwest France
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE River Adour; floodplains; aquifer
AB This study forms part of a French Government initiative supporting research into the function of wetlands as regulators of water regimes and supporters of a rich biodiversity. Aquifer recharge has been studied in a section of the floodplain of the River Adour, between Saubusse and Le Vimport, one of the major wetland areas in southwest France. The study has focused primarily on a major flood event observed during 6 to 19 March 1999. The March flood allows 2.1 x 10(6) m(3) of water to be stored in the sub-surface as the water-table rises to the surface of the floodplain giving complete saturation. After the passage of the flood wave, the water table declines to a level that restores the original volume of water stored in the subsurface. The 7 km(2) floodplain has an estimated total sub-surface storage capacity of similar to6.3 x 10(6) m(3) down to a layer of impermeable clay. During summer low water periods, the sub-surface storage is estimated to be similar to4.2 x 10(6) m(3) (i.e., 67% of the total available sub-surface storage in the zone studied). A hydrologic balance was calculated for the flood event that considers inputs and. outputs to the floodplain. The input volume from stream overflow, surface runoff, rainfall, and input from a small stream in the floodplain was estimated to be 6.9 x 10(6) m(3) (of which 5.6 x 10(6) m(3) is retained on the surface). Water outputs including drainage channels, direct drainage by the river, and evapotranspiration were estimated to be 7.5 x 10(6) m(3). These volumes contribute water representing ca. 1.4% of the total flood event flow of 5.40 x 10(8) m(3). Relatively low nitrate concentrations and associated low conductivities were observed in the water sampled at a number of piezometers placed within the study zone. A mechanism is suggested that involves the mixing of water of low nitrate content and conductivity from small streams and the sub-surface within the floodplain, with water containing elevated levels of dissolved nitrate and high conductivity from the River Adour.

AB Golden Bear Oil (GB-1111, legal trade name for GB-1313) is a petroleum distillate that is used in the United States and other countries as a larvicide for mosquito suppression. As part of a multi-species evaluation of the potential effects of GB-1111 on birds, red-winged blackbird eggs were collected, artificially incubated, and treated with one of five amounts of GB-1111 varying from 0 to 10 times the expected exposure from a spray application of the maximum recommended amount (X=47 1/ha, 5 gal/ac). The application of 10 X caused a significant reduction in hatching success. A dose-related reduction of hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activity (EROD) was detected. Among body weights, skeletal measurements, and age at death, only crownrump length was different among experimental groups. Overall, the potential hazard to embryos of a representative wetland passerine appears minimal until the application rate exceeds 3 X. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Most reports on mercury (Hg) in boreal ecosystems are from the Nordic countries and North America. Comparatively little information is available on Hg in wetlands in China. We present here a study on Hg in the Tangwang River forested catchment of the Xiaoxing'an Mountain in the northeast of China. The average total Hg (THg) in peat profile ranged from 65.8 to 186.6 ng g(-1) dry wt with the highest at the depth of 5-10 cm. THg in the peat surface was higher than the background in Heilongjiang province, the Florida Everglades, and Birkeness in Sweden. MethylHg (MeHg) concentration ranged from 0.16 to 1.86 ng g(-1) dry wt, with the highest amount at 10-15 cm depth. MeHg content was 0.2-1.2% of THg. THg and MeHg all decreased with the depth. THg in upland layer of soil (0-20 cm) was comparable to the peat surface, but in deeper layers THg concentration in peat was much higher than that in the forested mineral soil. THg in the peat bog increased, but MeHg decreased after it was drained. THg content in plant was different; THg contents in moss (119 ng g(-1) dry wt, n = 12) were much higher than in the herbage, the arbor, and the shrubs.

AB A pilot-scale constructed wetland unit, consisting of free water surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) constructed wetlands arranged in series, was integrated into an outdoor recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for culturing Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). This study evaluated the performance of the wetland unit in treating the recirculating wastewater and examined the effect of improvement in water quality of the culture tank on the growth and survival of shrimp postlarvae. During an 80-day culture period, the wetland unit operated at a mean hydraulic loading rate of 0.3 m/day and effectively reduced the influent concentrations of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5, 24%), suspended solids (SS, 71%), chlorophyll a (chl-a, 88%), total ammonium (TAN, 57%), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N, 90%) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N, 68%). Phosphate (PO4-P) reduction was the least efficient (5.4%). The concentrations of SS, Chl-a, turbidity and NO3-N in the culture tank water in RAS were significantly (Pless than or equal to0.05) lower than those in a control aquaculture system (CAS) that simulated static pond culture without wetland treatment. However, no significant difference (Pless than or equal to0.05) in BOD5, TAN and NO2-N was found between the two systems. At the end of the study, the harvest results showed that shrimp weight and survival rate in the RAS (3.8 +/- 1.8 g/shrimp and 90%) significantly (Pless than or equal to0.01) exceeded those in the CAS (2.3 +/- 1.5 g/shrimp and 71%). This study concludes that constructed wetlands can improve the water quality and provide a good culture environment, consequently increasing the shrimp growth and survival without water exchange, in a recirculating system.

AB Total mercury (TotHg) and methyl mercury (McHg) concentrations were studied in runoff from eight small (0.02-1.3 km(2)) boreal forest catchments (mineral soil and peatland) during 1990-1995. Runoff waters were extremely humic (TOC 7-70 mg l(-1)). TotHg concentrations varied between 0.84 and 24 ng l(-1) and MeHg between 0.03 and 3.8 ng l(-1). TotHg fluxes from catchments ranged from 0.92 to 1.8 g km(-2) a(-1), and MeHg fluxes from 0.03 to 0.33 g km(-2) a(-1). TotHg concentrations and output fluxes measured in runoff water from small forest catchments in Finland were comparable with those measured in other boreal regions. By contrast, MeHg concentrations were generally higher. Estimates for MeHg output fluxes in this study were comparable at sites with forests and wetlands in Sweden and North America, but clearly higher than those measured at upland or agricultural sites in other studies. Peatland catchments released more MeHg than pure mineral soil or mineral soil catchments with minor area of peatland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this research was to determine the abundance of the nitrogen-fixing shrub, Alnus incana ssp. rugosa (speckled alder), in shrub wetlands of the Adirondack Mountain region of New York State and to determine whether its abundance affects the concentration or accumulation of inorganic nitrogen in wetland substrates. Alder/willow wetlands are the second most common wetland type in the Adirondack region. The Adirondack Park Agency's digital GIS database of wetland types was used to determine the areal extent of alder/willow wetlands in the Adirondacks. Randomly selected wetlands were sampled to determine the size and abundance of alder. Alder densities averaged similar to 7000 stems ha(-1) and alder was present in 75 % of the wetlands. As an indication of short-term accumulation of NO3- and NH4+ in wetland substrates, ion exchange resins were used to sample ground water in high and low alder density wetlands as well as from wetlands lacking alder and dominated by conifers. Additionally, NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in ground water samples were measured. NH4+ accumulation levels from exchange resins were low for all wetland types while groundwater NH4+ concentration was highest in the low-density alder sites. Wetlands with high alder density had approximately six times higher NO3- accumulation than other wetlands. Substrate groundwater NO3- concentrations in wetlands of high-density alder exceeded by three times levels in low or no alder wetlands, showing the importance of alder to local N budgets. To assess the recovery of shrub wetlands from acidification, future studies should determine the fate of fixed N in wetland systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on the nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry in Adirondack northern hardwood ecosystems were summarized. Specific focus was placed on results at the Huntington Forest (HFS), Pancake-Hall Creek (PHC), Woods Lake (WL), Ampersand (AMO), Catlin Lake (CLO) and Hennessy Mountain (HM). Nitrogen deposition generally decreased from west to east in the Adirondacks, and there have been no marked temporal changes in N deposition from 1978 through 1998. Second-growth western sites (WL, PHC) had higher soil solution NO3- concentrations and fluxes than the HFS site in the central Adirondacks. Of the two old-growth sites (AMO and CLO), AMO had substantially higher NO3- concentrations due to the relative dominance of sugar maple that produced litter with high N mineralization and nitrification rates. The importance of vegetation in affecting N losses was also shown for N-fixing alders in wetlands. The Adirondack Manipulation and Modeling Project (AMMP) included separate experimental N additions of (NH4)(2)SO4 at WL, PHC and HFS and HNO3 at WL and HFS. Patterns of N loss varied with site and form of N addition and most of the N input was retained. For 16 lake/watersheds no consistent changes in NO3- concentrations were found from 1982 to 1997. Simulations suggested that marked NO3- loss will only be manifested over extended periods. Studies at the Arbutus Watershed provided information on the role of biogeochemical and hydrological factors in affecting the spatial and temporal patterns of NO3- concentrations. The heterogeneous topography in the Adirondacks has generated diverse landscape features and patterns of connectivity that are especially important in regulating the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3- concentrations in surface waters.

AB Cadmium and lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of Mallards and Wood Ducks collected from two waterfowl management areas along the Illinois River, USA, during the autumn and late winter of 1997-1998. Lead concentrations in livers of Mallards were lower than previously reported, and, along with those in a small sample of Wood Duck livers, were within background levels (<2.0 mug/g wet weight). Mean concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks utilizing the Illinois River were four times greater than in after-hatch-year Mallards, and 14 times greater than in hatch-year Mallards. Concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks were comparable with those of specimens dosed with cadmium or inhabiting contaminated areas in previous studies. Wood Ducks utilizing wetlands associated with the Illinois River, and presumably other portions of the lower Great Lakes region, may be chronically exposed to cadmium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Over the past several decades, populations of the common reed, Phragmites australis, have expanded rapidly in salt marshes of coastal North America; creating dramatic,changes in community composition. Populations of Phragmites in coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes may similarly threaten the ecological integrity of these inland wetland communities. Strategies for the conservation of biodiversity in these wetlands should be informed by an understanding of both the recent trends and the historic role of Phragmites in these wetlands. A combination of paleoecological and genetic analyses was used to determine when Phragmites became established in a Lake Superior coastal wetland and whether the source of Phragmites was native or non-native populations. Radiocarbon-dated stratigraphic changes in the abundance of pollen and macroscopic plant remains were used to infer the timing of vegetation changes in the wetland. From about 1100-490 C-14 yr ago, low water levels were associated with a lowland conifer forest with wetland swales at this site. At about 490 BP, conifers became less common, and peatlands became established at the site, perhaps in response to higher water levels in the wetland. There is no evidence that Phragmites grew at the site until the last several decades, suggesting that it is not native to this wetland and that its recent expansion may create significant changes in the wetland community. However, genetic data from chloroplast DNA sequences and microsatellite markers indicate that it is a variety that is native to North America and common throughout the Midwest. Our results suggest that human-induced changes in the landscape in combination with long-term environmental changes may play an important role in the expansion of native Phragmites populations.

AB Descriptive studies are an important first step in developing assessment models for regional wetland subclasses. Objectives of this study were to gather benchmark information on the composition and structure of vegetation from minimally impacted riparian forested wetland sites in Michigan, USA, and to determine if species composition of the breeding bird community and relative densities of individual species varied among riparian and adjacent upland forest zones. Plant species richness, dominance, and structure differed greatly between floodplain wetlands and uplands and were similar among zones within floodplain forests. Of 54 breeding bird species recorded through point count surveys (1998-99), 39 were observed in both floodplain and upland forests, while 11 were found only in floodplains and 4 solely in the uplands. Detectable patterns of avian density across riparian and upland forest zones were evident for 31 breeding species. Most species preferred areas closest to the river over other zones, although a few species were more prevalent within interior floodplains or uplands as compared to riverside forests. Forested riparian wetlands in this region act as essential breeding habitats for many avian species not often found in upland areas and are especially important for obligate riparian species and rare or declining breeding birds observed within our sites. These results are consistent with many studies across North America, where riparian forests have been found to support disproportionately large numbers of breeding bird species as compared to more xeric forests and other upland habitats.

AB The chironomid fauna living on an exotic macrophyte, Eurasian water milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), was studied quantitatively for a year in experimental ponds constructed to simulate reservoir wetlands. A total of 10 species, 2 Orthocladiinae, 5 Chironominae, and 3 Tanypodinae, were recorded. Of these 10 chironomid species, Apedilum elachistum comprised 79% of all chironomid larvae collected on the plants. Annual production of A. elachistum was estimated by the size-frequency method to be 9.9 g dry mass/m(2)/yr for milfoil surface area, which is among the highest production estimates reported for a single species. Annual production/biomass was 79/yr. Laboratory-reared larvae required an average of 23 days at 15degrees, 16 days at 20degrees, and 11 days at 25 degreesC to complete their development from first instar to imago.

ID VEGETATION
AB Numerous landscape depressions on the High Lava Plain of southeast Oregon, USA are ponded in most years, but their wetland status has not been examined closely. We applied the standard wetland criteria (hydrology, soils, and vegetation) to one such pool to evaluate whether the pool meets federal criteria as a jurisdictional wetland. Welland hydrology was determined to be present based on data from piezometer and ponding observations. Soils were determined to be hydri based on hydrology, soil temperature, and redox potentials. Vegetation met wetland criteria according to the 50/20 rule. Vegetation was similar to that of California Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools. Oregon pools are locally called "upland playas," but they fit the definition of vernal pools. Many southeast Oregon vernal pools are dug out as waterholes for livestock, increasing ponding depth and duration. Increased water availability can alter biological communities within pools and on surrounding semi-arid uplands. Effects due to grazing and excrement inputs have not yet been investigated. Vernal pools constitute distinct habitat sites within semi-arid landscapes and, therefore, probably play an important, and so far poorly understood, ecological role on the southeast Oregon steppe.

TI Artesian blister wetlands, a perennial water resource in the semi-arid
   rift valley of East Africa
SO WETLANDS
LA English

ID REMOTE-SENSING APPROACH; CENTRAL KENYA RIFT; BARINGO
AB A cluster of artesian springs encircled by mounds of marsh and wet meadows was discovered near the equator in Kenya, East Africa. Each spring is capped by a dense fibrous root mat that covers a mound of clayey peat with a blister of water in the center. Individual mounds are similar to 15 m wide, 1-2 m high, and affect an area of similar to50 m(2). The central water-blister volume is <1 m(3). The arched semi-permeable vegetation cap appears to be buoyed upward by slow artesian flow that leaks through the cap and moves slowly away. Lush plant growth (Poaceae and Cyperaceae, algae, diatoms, and filamentous cyanobacteria) is supported even through the dry season (Dec.-Feb.). The term "artesian blister wetland" is proposed for this unusual marsh, which has not been described previously. Approximately 20 small, circular-to-oval artesian blister wetlands occur within a large spring and wetland complex (similar to1.3 km(2)) that includes several freshwater Typha marshes fed by ground-water seeps. The springs discharge along a rift-related fracture system near the contact between volcanic bedrock and late Quaternary sediments. Cores (1-2 m) through the mounds revealed a dense root mat underlain by water in the center and a clayey peat that is locally pebbly at the base surrounding the blister. LOI in the clayey peat decreases from 75% at surface to similar to10% at 0.4-1.2 m. Blister water is cool, fresh, and dysaerobic (T = 30-33 degreesC; pH = 6.2-7.2; conductivity similar to600 iS/cm; and DO = 50%; 0.6-3.5 mg/l). The spring/wetland mounds likely form by the blanketing of the land around the spring orifice with vegetation (paludification). Plants and cyanobacteria seem to trap sediment transported by surface run-off and wind. The mound grows with time, but its height is limited by the magnitude of the hydraulic head. These ecological niches are important freshwater resources for animals and humans in semi-arid environments.

AB Seed fall from the parental plant and subsequent dispersal by tidal water flow were investigated in Aeschynomene virginica (sensitive joint-vetch) in order to understand how these processes may affect local population regeneration and inter-population seed exchange. Local seed fall was estimated using seed traps around four isolated plants. Plots enclosed on all four sides by mesh fences were compared to plots with the streamside open to examine seed dispersal by water flotation. Seed flotation times and stream flow rates were then used to estimate the potential for water dispersal of seeds after they have fallen to the soil. Ninety-four percent of all seeds fell within 0.5 m of maternal plants, with an exponential decrease in dispersed seeds with distance from the base of parental plants. More seeds left open plots than completely enclosed plots, but there was no difference between the number of seeds leaving plots that had standing vegetation and those without vegetation. At least 50% of the seeds placed in water remained floating after 28.4 hours, and 5% remained floating after 81.8 hours. Water flow rates in wetlands where A. virginica occurs naturally may carry seeds over 2600 m from the maternal plant, representing a significant potential for water dispersal of seeds in this species. Seed movement out of patches may impact population dynamics of the patch from which the seeds leave. Dispersing seeds cannot contribute to the population in that patch the following season. Seed dispersal may also represent an important mechanism for a species such as A. virginica, which specializes in open, newly created habitats, to find and colonize new habitat patches.

AB Four wetland restoration sites in the Emeralda Marsh Conservation Area located in central Florida, USA were flooded between 1992 and 1994. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission stocked largemouth bass in the flooded areas from 1992 to 1996. In 1996, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in flooded soils and in black crappie, brown bullhead catfish, and largemouth bass from the four sites. Areas 5 and 7 had the highest concentrations of total residual OCPs in the flooded soils, including dieldrin (385 +/- 241 mug/kg), sum of DDT, DDD, and DDE (7,173 +/- 1,710 mug/kg), and toxaphene (39,444 11,284 mug/kg). Sum of chlordane residuals was highest in area 5 (1,766 +/- 1,037 mug/kg). ANOVA indicated significant differences in location and fish muscle tissue concentrations for chlordane residuals, DDT residuals, and dieldrin. Fish from areas 5 and 7 had the greatest concentrations of chlordane residuals, DDT residuals, and dieldrin, which corresponded to the higher soil concentrations in these two areas. OCPs in muscle tissue were below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration action limits for human consumption. For three-year-old bass collected from Area 5, mean concentrations of chlordane residuals, DDT residuals, and dieldrin were 15-17 times higher in ovary tissue and 76-80 times higher in fat tissue compared with muscle tissue. Mean toxaphene levels in bass ovary and fat tissues were 9 and 39 times higher, respectively, than in muscle tissues. Tissue OCP concentrations were consistent,with site OCPs, regardless of fish species.

AB The capacity of Phragmites australis to extract nutrients from its environment and to store them in plant tissue was studied in an infiltration wetland used for wastewater treatment. The aims of the study were to estimate the contribution of plant uptake to the overall nutrient removal efficiency of the wastewater treatment system and to determine measures to enhance the nutrient removal efficiency. The functional response of Phraginites australis to nutrient addition was studied at two levels of nutrient availability by comparing a wetland used for wastewater treatment with a natural, undisturbed wetland. In the nutrient-rich wastewater wetland, biomass production, nutrient content of plant tissue, shoot/root ratios, and translocation rates were much greater than in the natural wetland. In contrast, plant nutrient-use efficiencies of both nitrogen and phosphorus were much lower in the wastewater wetland. The lower nutrient-use efficiencies were probably due to (1) lower nutrient productivity, which was probably due to self-shading resulting in a lower photosynthetic activity, and (2) lower mean nutrient residence time, which can be explained by a higher litter production (higher shoot and leaf turnover). In the wastewater wetland, harvesting during winter removed only 9% of the total nitrogen input and 6% of the total phosphorus input associated with the loading of wastewater. The low nutrient removal efficiency by aboveground plant harvesting is caused by translocation of nutrients from shoots and leaves to rhizomes and roots in autumn. Nutrient removal efficiency of the wastewater wetland could be enhanced by 40-50% by harvesting at peak nutrient storage levels in the aboveground plant parts in August or September.

AB We present a Hydrogeologic Setting (HGS) framework and the results of subsequent field evaluation for minerotrophic fens throughout New York State, USA. HGS uses a hierarchical approach to link landscape properties to local environmental gradient and, therefore, the plant communities that are associated with calcareous wetlands. This framework was organized into three general classes (i.e., chemical, physical, and spatial), which cumulatively represent the primary top-down factors driving fen occurrence. For 45 fen sites in the New York Natural Heritage Program (NYNHP) database, landscape setting was inferred based on review of published materials (e.g., geologic, topographic, soils maps, and reports). To examine the relationship between HGS and local environmental gradients, nested observation well clusters were placed in 30 of the fen sites. Environmental gradients were quantified in the field (e.g., water depth, pore water pH, temperature, and specific conductivity) and laboratory (e.g., dominant ion and major limiting nutrients concentrations). Statistical analyses were used to relate HGS to local environmental gradients, ecological community, and fen indicator species occurrence. Results suggest that known New York fens occupy distinct hydrogeologic settings, that HGS is significantly correlated to local environmental gradients, and that HGS and local environmental gradients are significantly related to fen ecological community and indicator species occurrence. We used this HGS framework for fens, but the rationale provided may be applied more broadly or narrowly to a range of ecosystem types.

AB We report the results of an intensive study of forest structure and composition across a 1.4-m elevation gradient from the top of a natural levee into the backswamp of Bayou Des Familles, Jean Lafitte National Park, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, USA. At the southernmost edge of the great bottomland hardwood forest of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), forests of the Bayou Barataria-Des Familles distributary are undergoing rapid subsidence with resulting increased flood frequency, depth, and duration. We used data from a 4.6-ha permanently marked plot to examine patterns of distribution and regeneration in forest trees. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of 23 quadrats (20 x 100 m) from this plot showed variation in forest composition across this 1.4-m elevation gradient corresponding to bottomland hardwood forest Zones III (semipermanently flooded) through V (temporarily flooded). A comparison of the size-frequency distributions of common species in upper, middle, and lower sectors of the gradient revealed deficient and poor recruitment in Quercus virginiana, Acer negundo, Celtis laevigata, and Salix nigra and episodic regeneration in Liquidambar styraciflua, Taxodium distichum, and Quercus nuttallii. Recruitment of the exotic species, Sapium sebiferum, is occurring at the low end of the gradient, as well as in canopy gaps throughout the gradient. Logistic regressions of sapling (<10 cm dbh) and tree (greater than or equal to10 cm dbh) size classes as a function of elevation showed that saplings of L. styraciflua, Q. nigra, and U. americana occur at higher elevations than do adult trees of the same species, evidence of the rate of hydrologic change in this forest. A fourth species, Acer rubrum, resprouts vigorously under rising water levels and may be an effective competitor with more light-demanding, flood-tolerant species at low elevations.

AB Water levels fluctuate widely in Carolina bay wetlands and most dry periodically. Aquatic organisms inhabiting these wetlands have the capacity to either resist desiccation or to recolonize newly flooded habitats. The objective of this study was to determine which invertebrates aestivate in the soil of dry Carolina bays and to describe how differences in habitat affect the composition of aestivating invertebrates. Eight Carolina bays located on the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina, USA were examined for this study. Although all of the wetlands dried seasonally, three of the wetlands were relatively wet (inundated 47-92% of the year on average), one was intermediate, and four were relatively dry (inundated 20% of year on average). Sections of soil were removed from each bay during August and November when all sites were dry, placed into tubs, flooded, and covered with fine mesh. Invertebrates were sampled from the water biweekly for four weeks. Invertebrate assemblages were contrasted between naturally inundated bays and rehydrated samples, wetter and drier bays, August and November collections, and remnant ditches and the main basins. Common aestivating fauna included midges, dytiscid beetles, copepods, and cladocerans. The Jaccard's coefficient of similarity for invertebrates emerging from dry substrate and from naturally flooded wetlands (with both aestivators and colonizers) averaged 0.22. More taxa emerged from rehydrated samples from wetter bays than drier bays. Season affected which taxa emerged. Remnant ditches supported fewer taxa than basins. Aestivating invertebrates make up a significant component of Carolina bay fauna.

AB Extensive Salicornia beds along the Gulf of Kutchchh (northwest) and Tamilnadu (southeast) coasts were investigated with respect to vegetative structure and ambient environmental conditions. The width of the beds varied from approximately 5 in to 1000 in, depending upon the topography and tidal influence. The most extensive and healthy stands occurred in the regularly (20-50 tides month(-1)) inundated intertidal zones. The width of Salicornia beds in the Gulf of Kutchchh was greater than those along the Tamilnadu coast due to greater (0.83-7.2 in) tidal amplitude and flat topography. The sediments from beds of the Gulf of Kutchchh were rich (4.9-16.9% dry weight) in organic matter. The salt content in the sediments from Tamilnadu was relatively very low (0.08-0.1% dry weight) compared to sediments from the Gulf of Kutchchh (0.48-0.78% dry weight). Plant biomass, density, height, and frequency of occurrence in the more frequently inundated regions were greater than in the poorly or less frequently inundated intertidal regions. The average total biomass varied from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) and was mostly comprised of aboveground components. Peak biomass values of Salicornia were observed during September to February in the Gulf of Kutchchh, while along the southeast coast, they were observed during December to March. The growth of the S. brachiata seemed to be influenced primarily by the frequency of inundation, duration of atmospheric exposure at ebb tide, rainfall, and salinity and salt content of the ambient water and sediments, respectively. Average carbon and nitrogen content in the plants were estimated to be 21.7 +/- 1.9% and 0.8 +/- 0.17% (dry weight), respectively. The carbon content increased with increasing age of the plant, while protein content decreased. Constantly increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal wetlands warrant immediate protection of S. brachiata and other obligate halophytes, which are either threatened/vulnerable or endangered.

AB The expansion of urban and agricultural activities in watersheds of the Midwestern USA facilitates the conversion of species-rich sedge meadows to stands of Phalaris arundinacea and Typha spp. We document the role of sediment accumulation in this process based on field surveys of three sedge meadows dominated by Carex stricta, their adjacent Phalaris or Typha stands, and transitions from Carex to these invasive species. The complex microtopography of Carex tussocks facilitates the occurrence of other native species. Tussock surface area and species richness were positively correlated in two marshes (r(2) = 0.57 and 0.41); on average, a 33-cm-tall tussock supported 7.6 species. Phalaris also grew in tussock form in wetter areas but did not support native species. We found an average of 10.5 Carex tussocks per 10-m transect, but only 3.5 Phalaris tussocks. Microtopographic relief, determined with a high-precision GPS, measured 11% greater in Carex meadows than Phalaris stands. Inflowing sediments reduced microtopographic variation and surface area for native species. We calculated a loss of one species per 1000 cm(2) of lost tussock surface area, and loss of 1.2 species for every 10-cm addition of sediment over the sedge meadow surface. Alluvium overlying the sedge meadow soil had a smaller proportion of organic matter content and higher dry bulk density than the buried histic materials. We conclude that sedimentation contributes to the loss of native species in remnant wetlands.

   events
SO WETLANDS

   movements
ID POMACEA-PALUDOSA
AB Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) apparently have only a limited tolerance to wetland drying events (although little direct evidence exists), but their populations routinely face dry downs under natural and managed water regimes. In this paper, we address speculation that apple snails respond to decreasing water levels and potential drying events by moving toward refugia that remain inundated. We monitored the movements of apple snails in central Florida, USA during drying events at the Blue Cypress Marsh (BC) and at Lake Kissimmee (LK). We monitored the weekly movements of 47 BC snails and 31 LK snails using radio-telemetry. Snails tended to stop moving when water depths were < 10 cm; however, there was no apparent effect of water depth on distance traveled in water depths >10 cm. Snails moved along the greatest positive depth gradient (i.e., towards deeper water) when they encountered water depths between 10 and 20 cm. Snails tended to move toward shallower water in water depths greater than or equal to50 cm, suggesting that snails were avoiding deep water areas such as canals and sloughs. Of the 11 BC snails originally located in the area that eventually went dry, three (27%) were found in deep water refugia by the end of the study. Only one of the 31 LK snails escaped the drying event by moving to deeper water. Our results indicate that some snails may opportunistically escape drying events through movement. The tendency to move toward deeper water was statistically significant and indicates that this behavioral trait might enhance survival when the spatial extent of a dry down is limited. However, as water level falls below 10 cm, snails stop moving and become stranded. As the spatial extent of a dry down increases, we predict that the number of snails stranded would increase proportionally. Stranded Pomacea paludosa must contend with dry marsh conditions, possibly by aestivation. Little more than anecdotal information has been published on P. paludosa aestivation, but it is a common adaptation among other apple snails (Caenogastropoda: Ampullaridae).

AB We measured the amount and distribution of macroinvertebrates and seeds in four wetland habitats (short emergent, seasonal open water, semipermanent/permanent open water, and saitgrass [Distichlis spicata]) used by breeding ducks and shorebirds at a wetland complex in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, USA. Density of macroinvertebrates did not differ among habitats or sampling periods (P = 0.45), but dry mass, crude protein, and gross energy production were greater (P < 0.05) in short emergent than in other habitats. These differences were largely due to the greater dry mass of gastropods in short emergent than in other habitats. Total seed density, dry mass, crude protein, and gross energy differed among habitats and periods with interaction effects (P < 0.01). Although seed abundance varied among habitats and sampling periods, abundance was greatest in short emergent during all sampling periods. Breeding waterbirds consumed a variety of macroinvertebrates and seeds on the study area. Patterns of abundance among habitats of macroinvertebrates and seeds consumed by six waterbird species were not consistent with patterns of foraging habitat use by most ducks and shorebirds at this wetland complex. Our results indicate that estimates of food or nutrient abundance are useful in assessing the functional role of broad habitat types, but factors other than food abundance also influence avian selection of wetland foraging habitats.

AB Where wetlands receive urban runoff, Typha spp. and other invasive plants often displace the native vegetation. We tested the ability of nutrients (N and P) to increase vegetative growth of T. X glauca (a hybrid of T. latifolia and T. angustifolia). In the greenhouse, 17 treatments revealed that T. X glauca required both N and P for growth, and total leaf length was most stimulated where a higher proportion of P was added (7N:1P vs. 14N:1P, with N constant and P changed), regardless of concentration (the High treatment was 4X the Low treatment). In Gardner Marsh (Madison, Wisconsin, USA), we set up 28 plots (I X 6 m) that bisected the boundary between sedge meadow (graminoids) and T. X glauca, and we added a common lawn fertilizer (9N: 1P:4K) at high (62.5 g/m(2)), medium (31.3 g/m(2)), low (15.6 g/m(2)), and control (0 g/m(2)) rates on five dates, with n=7 plots/treatment. After one growing season, fertilizer addition increased T. X glauca ramet density, height, and biomass, especially where the sedge meadow graminoids were initially dominant. Aboveground biomass of T. X glauca in the high nutrient addition treatment (1029 +/- 256.1 g/m(2)) was more than double that for control plots (431 +/- 80.52 g/m(2)) overall, with the greatest percent increase in sedge meadow subplots. In contrast, native graminoids (mostly Carex spp.) did not respond to treatment, either in biomass or percent cover. Typha X glauca allocated nutrients to both growth and storage, as indicated by higher N and P concentrations in leaves, shoot bases, and rhizomes in plots with high nutrient addition. Because fertilizing the marsh enhanced the shoot growth of T. X glauca but not native graminoids, and because the 7N:1P treatment stimulated growth in the greenhouse, we suggest that wetland managers focus on reducing P inflows to urban wetlands. Fertilizer additions below those recommended by the manufacturer for new lawns (5X that of our highest treatment) should be more economical and have fewer impacts on receiving wetlands.

AB The Columbia Wastewater Treatment Wetland ("Columbia Wetland") is a constructed cattail wetland in the Missouri River floodplain outside Columbia, Missouri, USA. The wetland receives mixed primary and secondary effluent (60,000 ml d(-1), BOD5 approximate to30 mg L-1, TSS approximate to 13 mg L-1, NH4-N approximate to8 mg L-1) from a conventional treatment plant. During its first 6 years of operation (October 1994 through November 2000), the wetland received loadings of BOD, COD, and NH4-N averaging 50, 83, and 12 kg ha(-1) d(-1), respectively, of which averages of 74%, 30%, and 17%, respectively, were removed from the effluent. TSS (mean loading = 21 kg ha(-1) d(-1)) frequently increased in the wetland due to erosion and disturbance by waterfowl, but TSS removal efficiency increased with time and the development of macrophyte biomass and averaged 30% by 1998. The wetland typically removed >97% of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus, 36% of TN and 4% of TP. In comparison to other large treatment wetlands, BOD removal by the Columbia Wetland has been exceptionally efficient.

TI Geochemistry of water and ground water in the Nhecolandia, Pantanal of
   Mato Grosso, Brazil: Variability and associated processes
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE concentration; alkalinity; calcite; saline lakes; Nhecolandia; Pantanal;
   Brazil
AB A distinctive feature of the Nhecolandia, a sub-region of the Pantanal wetland in Brazil, is the presence of both saline and freshwater lakes. Saline lakes used to be attributed to a past and phase during the Pleistocene. However, recent studies have shown that saline and fresh water lakes are linked by a continuous water table, indicating that saline water could come from a contemporary concentration process. This concentration process could also be responsible for the large chemical variability of the waters observed in the area. A regional water sampling has been conducted in surface and sub-surface water and the water table, and the results of the geochemical and statistical analysis are presented. Based on sodium contents, the concentration shows a 1: 4443 ratio. All the samples belong to the same chemical family and evolve in a sodic alkaline manner. Calcite or magnesian calcite precipitates very early in the process of concentration, probably followed by the precipitation of magnesian silicates. The most concentrated solutions remain under-saturated with respect to the sodium carbonate salt, even if this equilibrium is likely reached around the saline lakes. Apparently, significant amounts of sulfate and chloride are lost simultaneously from the solutions, and this cannot be explained solely by evaporative concentration. This could be attributed to the sorption on reduced minerals in a green sub-surface horizon in the "cordilhieira" areas. In the saline lakes, low potassium, phosphate, magnesium, and sulfate are attributed to algal blooms. Under the influence of evaporation, the concentration of solutions and associated chemical precipitations are identified as the main factors responsible for the geochemical variability in this environment (about 92 % of the variance). Therefore, the saline lakes of Nhecolandia have to be managed as landscape units in equilibrium with the present water flows and not inherited from a past and phase. In order to elaborate hydrochemical tracers for a quantitative estimation of water flows, three points have to be investigated more precisely: (1) the quantification of magnesium involved in the Mg-calcite precipitation; (2) the identification of the precise stoichiometry of the Mg-silicate; and (3) the verification of the loss of chloride and sulfate by sorption onto labile iron minerals.

TI Effects of canopy gaps and flooding on homopterans in a bottomland

AB Canopy disturbance is a major factor affecting forest structure and composition and, as a result of habitat alterations, can influence insect communities. We initiated a field study to quantify the effects of canopy disturbance on aerial insect abundance and distribution within a bottomland hardwood forest along the Cache River, Arkansas, USA. We used passive flight-intercept traps to sample insects in canopy gap and forest interior habitats from May to July in 1996, 1997, and 1998. The hydrologic conditions of our study site varied among years: 1996 was relatively dry, 1997 incurred a long-duration flood, and 1998 was moderately wet. Of the 34,000+ Homopterans collected, many groups were distributed in a non-uniform manner among years and between habitats. Total Homopterans, two families of Homopterans, and six morphospecies were more abundant in canopy gaps than interior forest. Many Homopteran taxa were least abundant in 1997 following almost six months of flooding. Alternatively, relatively large Homopteran abundances were associated with the dry conditions of 1996 and the moderately wet conditions of 1998. Differences in Homopteran abundance among years and habitats may be related to differences in vegetation density. Canopy gaps supported more vegetation cover than the interior forest in all but the first sampling interval. In addition, similar to Homopteran abundance, vegetation density was lower in 1997 than in 1998. These results demonstrate that natural disturbance and flooding contribute to Homopteran abundance and distribution patterns in bottomland hardwood forests of the south central United States.

AB A three-year study of aboveground biomass and nutrient dynamics in twelve restored depressional wetlands of different ages demonstrated significant annual variability among sites. Annual variations appeared to be primarily due to differences in hydrologic conditions over the three years of the study. Differences among wetlands were not related to time since restoration. When data for all sites were combined, annual differences in biomass and most measurements of nutrients (concentrations and standing stocks) did not, however, differ significantly. These results suggest that differences that are measured at individual wetland sites may be less important at the landscape level. Biomass decreased from the outer temporary to inner submersed zone, and there were few differences among wetlands when the temporary, seasonal, and submersed zones were compared. Nutrient concentrations in the plant. biomass increased from the temporary zone to the submersed zone, resulting in few differences in nutrient standing crops across zones. Results from this study demonstrate that some measurements of restoration success (i.e., biomass production) should be used cautiously because they are likely to be highly variable among sites and across years and thus may be of limited use in post-restoration monitoring. Other ecosystem parameters (e.g., nutrient concentrations of biomass) are much more constant spatially and temporally, indicating that nutrient cycling processes in vegetation were established quickly following restoration. Nutrient characteristics of wetland vegetation thus may be a useful metric for evaluating restoration success or failure.

AB This study was carried out on a neglected component of wetlands: the picoplankton community. We analyzed the picoplanktonic community patterns and their related environmental factors in a hypertrophic semi-arid wetland located in Central Spain (Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park, TDNP). We determined the bacterial and autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance over a three-year period (1996: the end of a long drought period and 1997-1998: after flooding) in five sites of the wetland. The overall range of bacterial abundance was 0.2 x 10(6) to 10 x 10(6) cells/ml. The annual mean abundance increased in the wettest 1997. APP was composed mainly by coccoid phycocyanin-containing cyanobacteria, with the greatest abundance up to 25 X 101 cells/ml. The annual mean also increased considerably in wetter 1997-98. Despite the large APP biomass in some sites, its percentage of total phytoplankton biomass was low (the annual average did not exceed 1.5%). We observed spatial heterogeneity in the picoplankton fraction depending on the fluctuating hydrology: bacteria tends to spatial homogeneity after flooding while APP showed only similarity among the output sites. Among the considered predictive variables (temperature, phosphorus, nitrogen, zooplankton, phytoplankton) of the picoplanktonic dynamics, temperature was the most closely correlated to picoplankton, especially to bacterial abundance. Further, in two factorial, coupled-hierarchical laboratory experiments (constant temperature), we searched for control mechanisms of picoplankton. We tested (a) the trophic cascade hypothesis by analyzing the effect of presence/absence of mosquitofish (experiment 1) or directly modifying the zooplanktonic community (experiment 2) and (b) the bottom-up regulation by altering the nutrient conditions (presence/absence of sediment in experiment 1; reducing the nutrient content in experiment 2). Bacterioplankton failed to show any behavior related to trophic cascade direct effects, while nutrients increased its abundance. APP was affected positively by nutrients and negatively by zooplankton grazing.

AB Interest by land-management and regulatory agencies in using biological indicators to detect wetland degradation, coupled with ongoing use of this approach to assess water quality in streams, led to the desire to develop and evaluate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for wetlands that could be used to categorize the level of degradation. We under-took this challenge with data from coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, which have been degraded by a variety of human disturbances. We studied six barrier beach wetlands in western Lake Superior, six drowned-river-mouth wetlands along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and six open shoreline wetlands in Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Plant, fish, and invertebrate communities were sampled in each wetland. The resulting data were assessed in various forms against gradients of human disturbance to identify potential metrics that could be used in IBI development. Our results suggested that the metrics proposed as potential components of an IBI for barrier beach wetlands of Lake Superior held promise. The metrics for Lake Michigan drowned-river-mouth wetlands were inconsistent in identifying gradients of disturbance; those for Lake Huron open embayment wetlands were yet more inconsistent. Despite the potential displayed by the Lake Superior results within the year sampled, we concluded that an IBI for use in Great Lakes wetlands would not be valid unless separate scoring ranges were derived for each of several sequences of water-level histories. Variability in lake levels from year to year can produce variability in data and affect the reproducibility of data collected, primarily due to extreme changes in plant communities and the faunal habitat they provide. Substantially different results could be obtained in the same wetland in different years as a result of the response to lake-level change, with no change in the level of human disturbance. Additional problems included limited numbers of comparable sites, potential lack of undisturbed reference sites, and variable effects of different disturbance types. We also evaluated our conclusions with respect to hydrologic variability and other major natural disturbances affecting wetlands in other regions. We concluded that after segregation of wetland types by geographic, geomorphic, and hydrologic features, a functional IBI may be possible for wetlands with relatively stable hydrology. However, an IBI for wetlands with unpredictable yet recurring influences of climate-induced, long-term high water periods, droughts, or drought-related fires or weather-related catastrophic floods or high winds (hurricanes) would also require differing scales of measurement for years that differ in the length of time since the last major natural disturbance. A site-specific, detailed ecological analysis of biological indicators may indeed be of value in determining the quality or status of wetlands, but we recommend that IBI scores not be used unless the scoring ranges are calibrated for the specific hydrologic history pre-dating any sampling year.

AB In tidal marshes of the northeast US, replacement of native cattail (Typha angustifolia) by the common reed (Phragmites australis) is widespread, and reed is often the target of removal efforts. Reed sequesters nearly twice the amount of nitrogen per unit marsh area in living aboveground tissue compared to cattail. Microbial decay processes immobilize additional nitrogen or return this organic nitrogen to the pool of inorganic nitrogen. We compared microbial growth during decay of standing and fallen litter of cattail and reed. Shoots of both plants were collected at the time of peak live biomass and then periodically throughout litter decomposition. Litter was analyzed for mass loss, nitrogen content, and biomass and production of fungi and bacteria. There were statistically significant but small differences in litter-associated microbial biomass and production between these two plants. Microbial production on both litter types was dominated by fungi, accounting for > 99% of the total. Living fungal biomass (estimated from ergosterol) associated with reed and cattail litter averaged 6.1 and 8.2 mg fungal C/g litter dry mass, respectively, and fungal nitrogen accounted for roughly 25% of the total nitrogen associated with litter. Detrital nitrogen standing stocks/m(2) were greater for reed than cattail throughout the first 2.5 years of decay. Therefore, the ability of reed litter to support decomposer growth is only somewhat lower and nitrogen retention is greater than for one of the plants it replaces. These differences are probably insufficient to argue for aggressive control of reed in tidal wetlands.

AB Finding environmental constraints on the establishment in salt marshes of Phragmites australis may help elucidate human activities that facilitated its invasion. We tested the effects of rhizome burial, salinity, anoxia, and sulfides on emergence, survival, growth, biomass production, and spread. In greenhouse and field experiments, rhizome burial facilitated initial emergence in well-drained soils. Rhizome emergence was prohibited in poorly drained treatments, regardless of salinity or sulfide concentrations. Emergence in well-drained treatments was not affected by salinity or sulfides, but survival, growth, and biomass storage of the culms and rhizomes were diminished in salt treatments. Combined with other studies, these results indicate that Phragmites invasion is a multi-stage process, with emergence constrained by poor drainage and survival constrained by lack of burial opportunities and salinity. These conditions constrain early stages of the invasion only, as later stages of the invasion can spread into anoxic and high salinity areas. These results also suggest that the process of invasion is facilitated by different human activities at different stages. Emergence is facilitated by soil disturbance, rhizome burial, and altered drainage. Survival through the first season can be facilitated through activities that lower porewater salinity.

AB In aquatic habitats, both vegetative and sexual reproduction are involved in vegetation maintenance. Restoration projects carried out in such habitats rarely consider the role of both sexual reproduction (seeds) and vegetative (vegetative propagules or clonal fragments) components of propagule banks in vegetation regeneration. Moreover, changes in the seed bank due to the restoration itself have rarely been studied. The aim of this paper is to answer the following questions. Does restoration consisting of sediment removal in a cut-off meander lead to a change in the propagule bank (both sexual and vegetative propagules), and does the vegetation regeneration involve vegetative propagules created by plant breakage during the disturbance? Vegetation was visually surveyed three times during a 15-year period before the restoration and two years afterwards in both the restored zone and an upstream undisturbed zone, The propagule bank was characterized just before and one year after the restoration in the restored zone by sampling of sediment cores and propagule germination in a greenhouse. The impact of restoration on the propagule bank was very pronounced. Sprouting propagules were three times more abundant in post-restoration samples than in pre-restoration samples. The ratio of seeds / vegetative propagules in the bank was lower in the year following restoration. Links between propagule bank and established vegetation were assessed through calculation of correlation and similarity indices. We observed a large difference between established vegetation and the propagule bank before restoration, suggesting that recruitment from the propagule bank was low before restoration. Restoration enhanced the recruitment from rhizomes and vegetative fragments, which were highly correlated with the established vegetation. The pre-eminent role of some vegetative propagules in the recolonization and the increasing abundance of an invasive species are related to the season (June) in which restoration was carried out. Impact of restoration on both the propagule bank composition and environmental conditions (especially those promoting or inhibiting germination or sprouting) thus has to be considered in further vegetation management work.

AB Ephemeral or "vernal" pools occur commonly throughout the forests of the northeastern United States and adjacent eastern Canada. These pools are critical breeding habitat for a number of amphibian species and support a diverse invertebrate community. The hydroperiod or duration of surface water of vernal pools affects faunal composition and reproduction. We conducted bathymetric surveys of 34 vernal pools located in central Massachusetts in early spring when the pools were at maximum extent after receiving snowmelt runoff. With these data, we estimated maximum pool depths, surface areas, perimeters, volumes, and basin profile coefficients. We calculated relative hydroperiod indices for the pools based on the presence or absence of surface water during periodic pool visits over the three-year study. The ranges of estimated pool morphological parameters were 0.11-0.94 m for maximum depth, 68-2941 m(2) for maximum surface area, 6-506 m(3) for maximum volume, and 30-388 m for maximum perimeter. Basin profile coefficients ranged between 0.60 (convex) and 2.24 (concave), with a median value of 1.02 (straight slope). Maximum pool depth was positively correlated with area and perimeter, but the correlations were only moderately strong, and there were many shallow pools with large surface areas. Correlations between basin profile coefficients and other morphological parameters were weak or non-significant. Maximum pool volume was proportional to the product of area and depth, but the proportionality constant was dependent on the basin profile coefficient. Relative hydroperiod was weakly correlated with pool morphometry; the strongest relationship was found between hydroperiod and maximum pool volume. In general terms, pools with a maximum depth greater than 0.5 m, a maximum surface area larger than 1000 m(2), or a maximum volume greater than 100 m(3) had surface water more than 80% of the times they were visited. In contrast, shallower pools, smaller pools, or pools with lesser volumes had varying hydroperiods. The weak relationships between pool morphometry and hydroperiod indicate that other factors, including temporal patterns of precipitation and evapotranspiration and ground-water exchange may have significant influence on vernal pool hydrology and hydroperiod.

AB Tillage can destroy or greatly disturb indicators of hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation, making delineation of tilled wetlands difficult. The remains of aquatic invertebrates (e.g., shells, drought-resistant eggs, and trichopteran cases) are easily identifiable and persist in wetland substrates even when wetlands are dry. Additionally, these remains are not easily destroyed by mechanical tillage. To test the feasibility of using invertebrate remains to delineate wetlands, we used two methods to identify the wetland edge of ten seasonal and ten temporary wetlands, evenly divided between grassland and cropland landscapes. First, we identified the wetland edge using hydric soil and vegetation indicators along six evenly spaced transects in each wetland (our "standard" delineation). We then identified the wetland edge along the same transects using aquatic invertebrate remains as our indicator. In grassland landscapes, delineations of the wetland edge made using invertebrate remains were consistently at the same location or closer to the wetland center as the standard delineations for both seasonal and temporary wetlands. In cropland landscapes, however, many of our invertebrate delineations of seasonal and temporary wetlands were on the upland side of our standard delineations. We attribute the differences to movement of remains during tillage, increased maximum Pool levels in cropland wetlands, and disturbance of hydric soils and plants. We found that the elevations of the wetland edge indicated by invertebrate remains were more consistent within a wetland than elevations determined by standard delineations. Aquatic invertebrate remains can be useful in delineating wetlands when other indicators have been destroyed or severely disturbed by tillage.

AB Nutrient loading is a subtle, yet serious threat to the preservation of high diversity wetlands such as peatlands. Pathways of nutrient loading and impacts on plant diversity in a small peatland in New York State, USA were determined by collecting and analyzing a suite of hydrogeological, hydro-chemical, soil, and vegetation data. Piezometer clusters within an intensive network constituted hydro-chemical sampling points and focal points for randomly selected vegetation quadrats and soil-coring locations. Hydrogeological data and nutrient analyses showed that P and K loading occurred chiefly by means of overland flow from an adjacent farm field, whereas N loading occurred predominantly through ground-water flow from the farm field. Redundancy analysis and polynomial regression showed that nutrients, particularly total P in peat, total K in peat, extractable NH4-N, and NO3-N flux in ground water, were strongly negatively correlated with plant diversity measures at the site. No other environmental variables except vegetation measures associated with eutrophication demonstrated such a strong relationship with plant diversity. Nitrate loading over 4 mg m(-2) day(-1) was associated with low plant diversity, and Ca fluxes between 80 and 130 mg m(-2) day(-1) were associated with high plant diversity. Areas in the site with particularly low vascular plant and bryophyte species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') occurred adjacent to the farm field and near a hillside spring. High H' and species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes occurred in areas that were further removed from agriculture, contained no highly dominant vegetation, and were situated directly along the ground-water flow paths of springs. These areas were characterized by relatively constant water levels and consistent, yet moderate fluxes of base cations and nutrients. Overall, this study demonstrates that knowledge of site hydrogeology is crucial for determining potential pathways of nutrient loading and for developing relationships between nutrient inflows and wetland plant diversity.

AB The Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada, a RAMSAR Wetland of International Significance, has since the 1970s been viewed as an ecosystem in decline. The putative reason for its decline has been the regulation of the Peace River by the W.A.C. Bennett Darn in British Columbia. The dying delta paradigm has its origin in a short-term study that coincided with a transient drawdown of the open drainage lakes in the delta. The paradigm has circumscribed all subsequent studies of the delta in its a priori assumption that all detected changes are due to the dam and are negative. As a result, the growth of scientific understanding has been stifled. Factors that contribute to the lack of ecological understanding include problems of data quality, quantity, and scale, ecological complexity, media marketing, failure to consult or analyze older/historical datasets. over-reliance on gray literature, too few wetland ecologists, and too little interdisciplinary thinking. Factors that may be involved in the recent changes, or lack of changes, include climatic variation and change, normal wetland dynamism, stochasticity, flow regulation, weirs, dredging, avulsions and their prevention, influxes of weeds and contaminants, delta evolution, and cultural change. The assessment of health in a delta is problematic since deltas are naturally stressed, dynamic ecosystems. Indicators of anthropogenic stress, such as declines in diversity and abundance, changes in biomass and primary production, or retrogressive succession may be difficult to apply in deltas. Long-term datasets are required that allow differentiation of normal from anthropogenic changes. Critique of the 'dying delta' view reveals little scientific support. The often-stated decline in flood frequency seems to have no statistical basis. The ecological health of the Peace-Athabasca Delta was assessed based on 26 attributes; 18 attributes indicated health, 3 indicated stress/disease, and 5 attributes were either neutral or required study. When compared to other major deltas in North America, the Peace-Athabasca Delta stands out as a paragon of ecosystem health. This study presents a cautionary lesson in the power of unchallenged paradigms in shaping scientific and popular opinion. A new paradigm views the delta as predominantly healthy, driven by large-scale natural processes, complex, and dynamically varying.

AB A study of more than 70 fens in the Midwestern United States and a review of the literature indicates that these temperate zone wetlands may differ from fens of the boreal zone and are not adequately differentiated from them by present classification systems. Fens of the Midwestern temperate zone 1) are wetlands with high botanical diversity, 2) are supported in part by ground water with conductivity > 100mS/cm and circumneutral pH, 3) contain water in the root zone during most of the growing season yet are not usually inundated, and 4) accumulate organic and/or carbonate substrates. Individually, none of these descriptors is adequate to distinguish fens from other wetland communities of the Midwest such as marshes, sedge meadows, and wet prairies; yet, when they are taken together, such discrimination is possible. While fens of this zone share many species, our study does not support using indicator species because too few are both faithfully represented and geographically widespread. Midwestern temperate fens are sustained by forces of climate, landscape, and geology, which permit ground water to seep continuously into the root zone in a focused location. Since water availability in the temperate Midwest is less than in the boreal zone, continuous discharge is needed to maintain the saturation conducive to peat formation.

AB In this study, we explored the habitat associations of the five most abundant passerine species nesting in the Ebro Delta reedbeds (NE Spain). Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no clear habitat association, In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater in less intensely-managed habitats, but only diversity was significant (p < 0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices.

AB Recently, Phragmites australis (common reed) in North American wetlands has changed from a species with limited distribution to an invasive species producing dense monospecific stands. This expansion has forced out other wetland vegetation, potentially changing the functions of these ecosystems. Little research has focused on whether P. australis stands serve as valuable wetland habitat and foraging areas for terrestrial animals and resident marsh nekton. This study addressed the effect of different hydrologic and geomorphic conditions among P. australis stands on abundance of resident nekton in Piermont Marsh, located on the lower Hudson River Estuary. Three P. australis-dominated sites (erosional creekbank, depositional creekbank, interior) were sampled for nekton using bottomless lift nets during day and night spring high tides during the months of July, August, and September, 1998. Hydrology data were collected for ten continuous days during each sampling period and included mean flooding depth, duration, and frequency for the three sites. Species captured on the marsh surface included Fundulus heteroclitus (common mummichog), Palaemonetes pugio (dagger-blade grass shrimp), Callinectes sapidus (blue crab), and Uca minax (brackish water fiddler crab). Results indicate that nekton and macrobenthos are using all areas sampled, and measured densities are comparable to those measured in some non-P. australis dominant wetlands elsewhere on the Hudson River. Although no strong correlation was made between nekton densities and hydrology, definite patterns were observed in the data. The results indicated that additional variables, such as geomorphology, might interact with hydrology to influence nekton use of the marsh surface. Although exact mechanisms controlling spatial variation of nekton use within P. australis stands still need to be elucidated, P. australis does seem to serve as nekton habitat.

AB Evapotranspiration and other surface-energy balance components of a wet prairie community dominated by Panicum hemitomon (maiden cane), Ptilimnium capillaceum (mock bishop's weed), and Eupatorium capillifolium (dog fennel) in Central Florida, USA were investigated. Drought conditions resulted in water-table levels from 0.58 to 1.20 m below ground level and variable soil wetness conditions during the observation period. Energy-balance measurements were made using the eddy correlation approach. The overall evapotranspiration rate was 4.16 mm d(-1), and the average Bowen ratio was 0.42. Energy partitioning had an enhanced sensible heat-flux component and a dampened latent heat-flux component when die volumetric soil water content was less than or equal to 0.09 for the sandy soil. Evapotranspiration was classified into a two stages, first stage (wet) and second stage (dry) based on the soil water availability. The Penman-Monteith model gave good results for the first stage evapotranspiration. The Priestley-Taylor and the Penman models overestimated first stage evapotranspiration. A simple second stage evapotranspiration model, developed by applying a reduction factor based on soil moisture to the Penman-Monteith model, provided improved estimates of evapotranspiration for second stage observations.

AB The Wisconsin Wetlands Inventory (WWI) was conducted by the State of Wisconsin, USA using a classification system and methods that are similar but not identical to those of the National Wetlands Inventory (WWI). Dissimilarities between the two inventories present problems for applications that cross state boundaries, such as inter-state comparisons or compilation of regional wetland statistics. The methods and classification systems of the two wetland inventories were compared, and GIS coverages were analyzed where the two inventories overlap near the cities of Superior and Baraboo. The NWI mapped both wetland and deepwater habitats and included Lacustrine and Riverine deepwater habitats that were intentionally not mapped by the WWI. Of the 178 km(2) Superior study area, 52% was mapped as upland by both, 22% was mapped as wetland by both, 10% was mapped as Palustrine wetland by NWI but not WWI, and 6% was mapped as wetland by WWI but not NWI. Of the 281 km2 Baraboo study area, 91% was mapped as upland by both, 52% was mapped as wetland by both, 1% was mapped as Palustrine wetland by NWI but not WWI, and 1% was mapped as wetland by WWI but not NWI. Errors of omission were found for both inventories, but errors of commission (i.e., areas incorrectly mapped as wetland) were found only for the NWI maps in the Superior study area, which were prepared using 1:80,000 black and white panchromatic aerial photos. In theory and in practice, the two inventories were nearly equivalent with regard to Palustrine wetland class and subclass. The WWI "hydrologic modifier" has fewer categories than the NWI "water regime," but a preliminary conversion table was developed to recode the WWI digital maps to their equivalent WWI categories based on the modal NWI water regime associated with each NWI class. Methods were developed for converting the WWI digital databases to make the two inventories more compatible; recommendations for future updates of the WWI include use of leaf-off color infrared aerial photography and merging of the digital WWI with a digital database of deepwater habitats.

AB The introduction of invasive species such as Phragmites australis in the Chesapeake Bay has been viewed to be deleterious to habitat quality. Little is known, however, on the extent to which the replacement of Spartina alterniflora by Phragmites affects hydrodynamics and sediment trapping on the surface of impacted marshes. This study examined sediment deposition, sediment mobility, and flow conditions in adjacent Phragmites australis and Spartina alternifora marshes in Prospect Bay, Maryland, USA in order to determine if differences in plant morphology affect surficial flow proper-ties and particle dispersion patterns. Measures of fine-scale flow dynamics, total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration, and particulate deposition were obtained at various distances from open water across the marsh surface over four sequential tidal cycles in Fall 1999. The hydrodynamic data indicate that both the gross and fine-scale properties of tidal flows were similar in both types of vegetation and that flow conditions were conducive to particle deposition. TSS concentrations did not differ between canopy types and decreased over time in both systems. There was no difference in TSS reduction over distance between Spartina and Phragmites. The sediment trap data indicate that maximum deposition occurs closer to open water in both Spartina and Phragmites and that the organic content of deposited matter increased with distance into the marsh interior. This study provides the first in situ, high resolution, over-marsh flow data for marshes dominated by Phragmites. The data provided herein suggest that differences in vegetative cover do not significantly affect flow regime, sediment transport, and sediment deposition patterns in the marsh systems examined.

AB We measured the effects of prescribed fire during January (dormant season) and May (growing season) on flowering of three perennial grasses, muhly (Muhlenbergia capillaris), gulfdune paspalum (Paspalum monostachyum), and south Florida bluestem (Schizachyrium rhizomatum), which are dominant grasses in wet prairies of south Florida, USA. Flowering was promoted by growing season fire but not by dormant season fire. Flowering was significantly greater for all species following prescribed fire conducted during May compared with areas burned during January of the same calendar year. The strong positive effect of growing season fire on flowering of all three species decreased after the first growing season. We rejected the hypothesis that season of fire did not influence flowering. Our results indicated that flowering by these dominant, wet prairie grasses is promoted by early growing season fire, which corresponds to historical patterns of lightning-ignited fire in south Florida.

   mitigation ratios
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article

ID FRESH-WATER WETLANDS
AB Compensatory mitigation has been a keystone of state and federal programs for regulating wetland loss. This study reviewed mitigation performance in Indiana, USA to propose mitigation ratios (area to be mitigated/area permitted for fill) based on the rate of wetland establishment by type. Between 1986 and 1996, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) required 345 mitigation sites. Of these, applicants constructed 214 of the sites; another 70 were not completed. No attempt was made to construct the required mitigation on 49 of the sites. Measurements of both the total wetland area and the area of each vegetation community in the mitigation site were taken at 31 of the sites identified as "constructed." IDEM required 34.33 ha to compensate for the 13.73 ha of state waters lost through the permit actions associated with these sites. The mapping effort found that a total of 15.21 ha of wetland and other waters had established, a net gain of 1.48 ha. Vegetation community mapping revealed that palustrine forested areas, which had a failure rate of 71%, and wet meadow areas (87% failure) were harder to establish than shallow marsh areas (17% failure) and open water areas (4% failure). These results suggest that federal and state regulatory agencies would have to require minimum mitigation ratios of 3.5:1 for palustrine forested, 7.6:1 for wet meadow, 1.2:1 for shallow marsh, and 1:1 for open water to compensate for the risk of failure. Additional mitigation may be needed to offset the effects of temporal loss of wetland function.

AB In the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), losses of bottomland hardwood forests have been severe, with less than 30% of the original 10 million ha remaining. Reforestation of abandoned farmland is occurring, but there has been little research on natural reestablishment of these forests. We examined understory succession and tree establishment patterns in a 3.2-ha field in northeast Louisiana, USA, abandoned in 1984. Relative elevation, strongly correlated with flooding depth and frequency, varied by approximately 1m. Ground-layer composition was monitored from 1985 to 1999 in twenty 1-m(2) quadrats stratified along the elevation gradient. In 2000, shrubs and tree saplings were mapped and their relative elevations determined. Ordination of the ground-layer data revealed that the major trends in species composition were related to time-since-abandonment and elevation. Annual species gradually declined, woody perennials became more abundant, and a shrub and young tree layer emerged from beneath the ground layer, but species composition in low and high elevation plots did not converge. Obligate species were more common at lower elevations, while facultative species were more common at upper elevations. By 16 years after abandonment, a total of 16 tree and shrub species had established in the field; eleven of these had potential local seed sources on levees adjacent to the study site. Abundance of dominant species was significantly related to elevation in most cases. In addition, distance to seed source influenced density and spatial distribution of Celtis laevigata and Fraxinus pennsylvanica. Our study suggests that rate and pattern of secondary succession in LMAV bottomlands are strongly influenced by elevation, dispersal mode of species, and the composition and proximity of forest remnants. Successful restoration of bottomland forests will require an improved understanding of these factors.

AB Insufficient sedimentation. coupled with high rates of relative sea-level rise (subsidence plus eustatic sea-level rise). are two important factors contributing to wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. USA. We hypothesized that adding nutrient-rich, secondarily treated wastewater effluent to subsiding wetlands in Louisiana could promote vertical accretion in these systems through increased organic matter production and subsequent deposition and allow accretion to keep pace with estimated rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). However. we also hypothesized that nutrient enrichment could stimulate the decomposition of organic matter, thus negating any increase in accretion due to increased organic matter accumulation. To test these hypotheses, We measured leaf-litter decomposition, litter nutrient dynamics. and sediment accretion in a permanently flooded and subsiding forested wetland receiving wastewater effluent and in an adjacent control site, both before and after effluent applications began. We also measured organic and mineral matter accumulation in the treatment site before and after effluent applications began. A Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) statistical analysis revealed that neither leaf-litter decomposition rates nor initial leaf-litter N and P concentration were affected by wastewater effluent. A similar analysis revealed that final N and P leaf-litter concentrations did significantly increase in the treatment site relative to the control after effluent was applied. Total pre-effluent accretion, measured 34 months after feldspar horizon markers were laid down, averaged ( SE) 22.3 +/- 3.2 mm and 14.9 +/- 4.6 mm in the treatment and control sites. respectively, and were not significantly different. However, total accretion measured 68 months after the markers were installed and 29 months after effluent additions began in the treatment site averaged 54.6 +/- 1.5 mm in the treatment site and 19.0 +/- 3.2 mm in the control site and were significantly different. Additionally, after wastewater applications began, the estimated rate of accretion in the treatment site (11.4 mm yr(-1)) approached the estimated rate of RSLR ( 123 mm yr-1). Most of this increase in accretion was attributed to organic matter inputs, as organic matter accumulation increased significantly in the treatment site after effluent application began, while mineral accumulation rates remained constant. These findings indicate that there is a potential for using wastewater to balance accretion deficits in subsiding wetland systems.

AB Paired plots were established across a soil moisture gradient (dry periodically flooded. flooded) in three forested wetland watersheds in Louisiana and South Carolina, USA in 1986-1987. All trees greater than 10-cm diameter at breast height were tagged and measured annually through 1999 to determine density, basal area changes, ingrowth. and mortality. A greater number of tree species was found in South Carolina dry and periodically flooded sites than in Louisiana. Flooded sites in both states were dominated by water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) and baldcypress (Taxodium distichum). The overall trend in density in both states was flooded > periodically flooded > dry. From 1987 to 1999, density decreased in all of the Louisiana sites except one, while in South Carolina, density remained the same or increased in four of the sites and decreased in the other four. The greatest changes in density occurred in those sites where water-level changes were occurring and in areas where storm winds struck. Basal area in 1987 was similar in both states. ranging from 20.8 to 55.2 m(2)/ha in Louisiana and 24.0 to 49.5 m(2)/ha in South Carolina. Flooded sites had the greatest basal area, and periodically flooded and dry sites had similar basal areas. Mortality rates in Louisiana and South Carolina forested wetlands are typically low (around 2%/year) in areas that have not been altered hydrologically. Annual mortality in Louisiana plots with increased water levels rose from 4% in 1987 to 16% in 1997. Wind storm events significantly increased mortality rates. and mortality rates remained high for years after the event. as damaged trees died. Of special concern are areas like the Verret Basin site where the exotic. invasive species Chinese tallow (Sapium sebiferum) invaded after Hurricane Andrew and has the potential to become a dominant canopy tree in the future.

AB In 1990, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP) implemented a small-wetland restoration program in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. Wetlands were restored by means of dredging accumulated sediment and organic debris to create open water and emulate pre-disturbance conditions. Three call surveys were conducted in the spring and summer of 1998 and 1999 to estimate abundance and occurrence of spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer). wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). American toads (Bufo americanus), and green frogs (Rana clamitans) on restored and reference wetlands. Numbers of species calling and abundance indices of northern leopard frogs. green frogs, and spring peepers were significantly higher on restored versus reference wetlands. The number of species calling in restored wetlands was positively correlated with proximity to freshwater rivers;, in reference wetlands. the number was positively associated with forested perimeters and area of open water. Occurrence of calling green frogs in restored wetlands was positively correlated with percent cattail and. in reference wetlands, with proximity to other wetlands. Our results suggest that small wetland restoration projects may be a good conservation tool for anurans. We recommend further research on reproductive success and on local population trends in restored wetlands to determine if restoration is beneficial for anurans on PEI.

AB Despite the importance of peatlands in the global carbon cycle, no widely applicable ecosystem model exists for peatlands. Simulations of three montane fens in Colorado. USA were conducted to test the capabilities of the CENTURY ecosystem model to simulate 1) long-term carbon accumulation and 2) short-term changes in carbon accumulation due to hydrologic changes. The CENTURY model was calibrated to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in two fens for up to 10.000 years by adjusting three variables that represent anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY was unable to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in a third fen using settings for the two calibrated fens, However. CENTURY correctly simulated total carbon storage by adjusting two of the three anaerobic variables. A sensitivity analysis revealed that carbon accumulation in CENTURY is highly sensitive to anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY predicted that half of the fen peat is composed of structural root material. The majority of the remaining peat was composed of recalcitrant slow and passive soil organic matter. Precipitation levels were altered to determine if CENTURY could predict the change in carbon accumulation rates due to periodic drier conditions. The simulated drying scenario predicted an average carbon loss of 70 g C m(-2) yr (1) during the 100-year simulation. The loss of carbon occurred despite plant production increasing from an average of 249 g C m (2) yr (1) to 391 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Slightly more than 90% of the carbon lost was from the structural root pool and slow organic matter pool, while there was no carbon loss or a slight net carbon gain in the passive organic matter pool and above-ground structural and metabolic pools. Despite several shortcomings, our results indicate that an ecosystem model, such as CENTURY, can be useful for simulating carbon dynamics in peatlands.

AB Secondary succession in wet grasslands has received surprisingly little attention. We analyzed the vegetation of a eutrophic alluvial wetland of western France and the relationship between its composition and environmental variables. The objectives of our study were twofold: (1) to describe species assemblages of wet grasslands and oldfields and correlate their species composition to hydrologic stress and (2) to study the changes in species composition, species richness, and species diversity when mowed meadows are abandoned. More than 100 species were recorded, and five species assemblages ('A' to 'E') were identified. Hydrology and land use (mowing versus land abandonment) were the two main ecological factors that affected plant community development. Hydrologic regime contributed to separate 'A'. 'B' (on the wettest end of the gradient) from 'C', 'D', and 'E' (on the driest end of the gradient). Land use helped to discriminate 'B'. 'C' from 'A, 'D' and 'E'. Larger-scale disturbances such as mowing maintain meadow species, leading to a high level of species richness, species diversity, and evenness. We compared the species richness, species diversity, and evenness according to the duration of land abandonment since last mowing disturbances (<5 years, 6-10 years, 11-15 years, 16-20 years). No significant differences were observed. Botanical composition of these plots did not differ significantly. In the first five years of land abandonment, there was an increase of litter, which reduces the species richness, diversity, and evenness. Live, above-ground biomass of grasslands was significantly greater than that of oldfields, but total organic matter (biomass + litter) was significantly greater for oldfields than for grasslands, Total biomass showed a negative logarithmic relationship with species richness. with species richness being initially high at very low standing crop levels (grasslands) and decreasing at greater levels of standing crop (oldfields).

AB Floristic quality assessment is potentially an important tool for conservation efforts in the northern Great Plains of North America. but it has received little rigorous evaluation. Floristic quality assessments rely on coefficients assigned to each plant species of a region's flora based on the conservatism of each species relative to others in the region. These "coefficients of conservatism" (C values) are assigned by a panel of experts familiar with a region's flora. The floristic quality assessment method has faced some criticism due to the subjective nature of these assignments. To evaluate the effect of this subjectivity on floristic quality assessments, we performed separate evaluations of the native plant communities in a natural wetland complex and three restored wetland complexes. In our first assessment. we used C values assigned "subjectively" by the Northern Great Plains Floristic Quality Assessment Panel. We then performed an independent assessment using the observed distributions of species among a group of wetlands that ranged from highly disturbed to largely undisturbed (data-generated C values). Using the panel-assigned C values, mean C values W) of the restored wetlands rarely exceeded 3.4 and never exceeded 3.9. with the highest values occurring in the oldest restored complex, all but two wetlands in the natural wetland complex had a,C greater than 3.9. Floristic quality indices (FQI) for the restored wetlands rarely exceeded 22 and usually reached maximums closer to 19, with higher values occurring again in the oldest restored complex: only two wetlands in the natural complex had an FQI less than 22. We observed that 95% confidence limits for species richness and percent natives overlapped greatly among wetland complexes. whereas confidence limits for both C and FQI overlapped little. C and FQI values were consistently greater when we used the data-generated C values than when we used the panel-assigned C values, nonetheless. conclusions reached based on these two independent assessment techniques were virtually identical. Our results are consistent with the opinion that coefficients assigned subjectively by expert botanists familiar with a region's flora provide adequate information to perform accurate floristic quality assessments.

AB Knowledge of wetland hydrology, soil redox potential, pH, and temperature dynamics are key components required to understand the capacity of tidal wetlands to function, in particular to attenuate agrichemicals. In a freshwater tidal wetland along the James River in Virginia, USA, redox potential, pH, water-table level, and soil temperature were monitored continuously at two depths (20 and 50 cm) at three sites during a 12-month period from September 1, 1997 to August 31. 1998. Redox potentials were at or below - 150 mV (methanogenic or sulfate reducing conditions) at the 50-cm depth during the entire monitoring period. At the 20-cm depth. redox potentials remained highly reducing 95% of the time. The soil is continuously wet throughout the year, with the water-table level above the 20-cm soil depth for 95% of the time. Water-table level or hydrology was the primary factor controlling fluctuations in the redox state. Soil pH values were generally between 6 and 8, and they dropped I pH unit upon an oxidation event. which was reversible. Soil temperature at the 50-cm depth never dropped below 5degrees C, indicating a year-round biological activity season. This wetland supports a large diversity of plant species. Permanently reduced sub-surfaces, year-round biological activity, and large organic matter accumulations are characteristic features of this freshwater tidal wetland.

AB Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is considered one of the worst invasive non-native species of North American wetlands, but its reputation rests on few published, quantitative field studies. This study described the vegetation of two sites (one flooded, one drier) within a heavily invaded wetland in southeastern New York, in order to investigate the common claim that purple loosestrife produces monospecific, stands. Native species richness per square meter was 6.8, on average, with mean percent cover ranging from 0.03 to 6.7%, compared to 49% for purple loosestrife. One grass, Phalaris arundinacea, covered on average 31.1% of the area in drier site plots. Twenty-six native taxa were found in a total of 18 1-m(2) plots. I also conducted an experimental manipulation of the plant community in both sites to demonstrate the role of purple loosestrife in gap colonization. Three 1-m2 experimental gaps in each site were recolonized by purple loosestrife at very low density after three years (mean percent cover 1.7), even though recruitment in the drier site was heavy in the first summer. I compared vegetation in the three recolonized gaps, three additional gaps in which purple loosestrife recolonization was prevented, and three unmanipulated control plots, Community structure was not statistically different among these treatments after three years (measured as species richness, Shannon diversity index, or percent cover) because removal plots became dominated by one or two grass or sedge species that replaced purple loosestrife in the community. Recolonized plots contained an average of 6.3 native taxa. Six of the colonizing taxa at each site were not present prior to manipulation. The results show that purple loosestrife stands were not monospecific in this wetland, that other non-native species may dominate if purple loosestrife is removed, and that small gaps may provide regeneration niches for other species.

AB A controlled feeding study and field collections of duck feces were used to examine the potential of ducks for dispersing wetland plant species in the prairie pothole region of North America. To determine how long seeds of wetland species remain in their digestive system, captive mallards were fed known quantities of seed of either Atriplex patula, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium rubrum, Echinochloa crusgalli, Polygonum spp., Scirpus acutus, Scirpus validus, or Sparganium eurycarpum. Fecal samples were collected hourly from ducks for 24 to 30 hours after seeds were ingested. On average, 23% of the seeds ingested were recovered intact, and 36% of these were still viable. In other words. only 7% of the seeds ingested were still viable when they were evacuated, with a range from 1% for Echinochloa crusgalli to 16% for Scirpus validus. The mean passage time of seeds was 7.6 h, with a range of 5.1 h for Echinochloa crusgalli to 11.1 h for Chenopodium rubrum. Nearly all seeds were evacuated after 24 to 30 h. Seed size and seed coat strength (lignin content) were negatively correlated with the probability of a viable passage but not correlated with passage rates. After ingestion, mallards are estimated to be able to transport internally viable seeds up to 1,400 km but more typically 20 to 30 km. Field collections of duck feces at five locations in the prairie pothole region confirmed that ducks are dispersing intact seeds of common wetland species (Carex sp., Echinochloa sp., Panicum sp., Polygonum spp., Potamogeton spp., Salix sp., and Scirpus spp.). There were between 0.3 to 5.2 intact seeds per duck. Only 1.6% of this intact seed of four taxa (Carex sp., Potamogeton spp., Salix sp., and Scirpus spp.) germinated under greenhouse conditions. Although any given duck is carrying only a few viable seeds, the millions of ducks moving among wetlands, especially during spring and fall migrations, collectively are effective dispersal agents for many wetland plant species.

AB Because the North American Breeding Bird Survey provides inadequate coverage of wetland habitat, the Wetland Breeding Bird Survey was recently established in Ohio. USA. This program relies on volunteers to conduct 3 counts at each monitored wetland. Currently, all counts are conducted during the morning. Under the premise that volunteer participation could be increased by allowing evening counts, we evaluated the potential for modifying the methodology. We evaluated the sampling efficiency of all 3-count combinations of morning and evening counts using data collected at 14 wetlands. Estimates of overall species richness decreased with increasing numbers of evening counts. However, this pattern did not hold when analyses were restricted to wetland-dependent species or those of conservation concern. Our findings suggest that it would be reasonable to permit evening counts, particularly if the data are to be used to monitor wetland-dependent species and those of concern.

AB The ability or individual species to tolerate or accumulate heavy metal pollutants has been investigated widely. Although invasive species may become established more easily in disturbed environments, relatively little is known about how an ability to tolerate pollutants might give invasive species a competitive advantage. This study is part of a series of experiments investigating native and invasive species interactions with chemical pollution and other forms of disturbance. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects or lead on the growth of Lythrum salicaria. We exposed plants to different concentrations of lead and measured different growth parameters, such as biomass, length, leaf number, and biomass allocation to roots. For most measures, plants grown in lead-free conditions were larger than plants exposed to lead. Plants in the low (500 mg/l) and medium (1000 mg/l) lead treatments did not differ from cacti other, while plants in the high (2000 mg/l) lead treatment were significantly smaller. However, the biomass allocation to roots was not significantly different among treatments. Although their growth is affected, individuals of Lythrum salicaria demonstrated tolerance to lead contamination, which may aid in their colonization in lead-polluted wetlands.

AB Carolina buys are freshwater wetlands that serve as important feeding habitats for the endangered wood stork (Mycteria americana). Water levels in these bays fluctuate greatly and tend to be acidic and rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), factors that favor mercury (Hg) methylation and bioaccumulation in fish. To assess potential risks to wood storks consuming mercury contaminated Fish in bays, we sampled fish from 10 bays on the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, an area with documented use by wood storks. Whole body mercury concentrations in 258 fishes of three species (Erimyzon sucetta, Acantharchus pomotis and Esox americanus) commonly consumed by wood storks were determined. Risk factors for nestlings and free-ranging adults were calculated using published no and lowest observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC and LOAEC) values for birds. Fish from higher trophic levels and those from wetlands with relatively shallow maximum depths and fluctuating water levels were more likely to exceed NOAEC and LOAEC values. Calculation of exposure rates of nestling wood storks indicated they arc at highest risk during the first 10 days of the nestling period. These calculations suggest that there is potential concern for wood storks foraging in relatively shallow bays with fluctuating water levels, even though there is no obvious local source of mercury to these wetlands.

AB In recent decades sulphate concentrations in the ground water in many parts of the Netherlands have increased dramatically resulting in increased production of iron-(di)sulphides in sediments of ecosystems fed by this water. A sediment survey was carried out to study the potential sensitivity of wetlands to drought and subsequent acidification as a consequence of iron-(di)sulphide oxidation. Dessication led to severe acidification and mobilisation of heavy metals when the sediment S/(Ca + Mg) ratio exceeded 2/3. A total of 47% of the investigated locations contained S/(Ca + Mg) ratios higher than 2/3 and in 100, 75 and 50% of the locations mobilisation of Zn, Cd and Ni exceeded the Dutch signal value for ground water. Consistent with the sediment survey, lime addition experiments confirmed that increasing the buffer capacity, down to a S/(Ca + Mg) ratio 2/3, led to a drastic inhibition of the acidification and heavy metal percolation from dredged sediments. The performance of the same processes under drained field conditions demonstrates the relevance of these processes during dry summers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NITROGEN REMOVAL; BIOLOGICAL DENITRIFICATION
AB Several microcosm wetlands implanted and planted with five macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Commelina communis, Penniserum purpureum, Ipomoea aquatica, and Pistia stratiotes) were employed to remove nitrate from groundwater at a concentration of 21-47 mg NO3-N/l. In the absence of external carbon, nitrate removal rates ranged from 0.63 to 1.26 g NO3-N/m(2)/day for planted wetlands. Planted wetlands exhibited significantly greater nitrate removal than unplanted wetlands (P<0.01), indicating that macrophytes are essential to efficient nitrate removal. Additionally, a wetland planted with Penniserum showed consistently higher nitrate removal than those planted with the other four macrophytes, suggesting that macrophytes present species-specific nitrate removal efficiency possibly depending on their ability to produce carbon for denitrification. Although adding external carbon to the influent improved nitrate removal, a significant fraction of the added carbon was lost via microbial oxidation in the wetlands. Planting a wetland with macrophytes with high productivity may be an economic way for removing nitrate from groundwater. According to the harvest result, 4-11% of nitrogen removed by the planted wetland was due to vegetation uptake, and 89-96% was due to denitrification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Eggshell quality, clutch size, sex ratio, and hatching success of western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) and ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) were studied on a landscape-soil contaminant gradient at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico from 1997 to 1999. A variety of contaminants (heavy metals, chemicals, insecticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorines, and radioactive isotopes) range across different spatial scales and concentrations on LANL land. This study is an example of a monitoring program over a large area with varying degree of contamination that is used to highlight locations of concern for future research, There were two locations where the flycatcher had a lower hatching success. The bluebirds at Sandia wetland, a location of concern for PCBs, had a thinner eggshell thickness index (RATCLIFFE) and the eggs were smaller than at other locations. The flycatcher had thinner eggshells than bluebirds, which could add to sensitivity to exposure to containinants. There was no variation in clutch size or sex ratio between locations or areas closer to contaminant release sites for both species. Percent females in the clutch ranged from 0 to 100% in the WEBL and from 33 to 67% for ATFL. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of narrow buffer strips, in abating the NO3-N concentrations in the water coming from cropland was tested in an experiment carried out on the low plains of the Veneto Region (northeast Italy). The buffer was composed of a 5-m wide grass strip and a 1-m wide row of trees. Maize and wheat were cultivated in the neighbouring field during the monitoring period (December 1997-June 1999). Four experimental conditions were monitored, deriving from a combination of two levels of crop N fertilisation and two sizes of buffer trees. The narrow buffer was very effective in abating NO3-N concentrations, allowing water to be discharged with a concentration always below 2 ppm. Its zone of influence might be bigger than its simple width. The abatement was also efficient during winter. Tree size showed no evident effect on the reduction of the concentration.

AB Major oil sands industrial companies are located in the Athabasca Oil Sands Deposit in northeastern Alberta, Canada. During the process used to extract light crude oil (via hot water digestion and flotation), gypsum is usually added to produce consolidated tails (CT) and CT release water. The vast volumes of process-treated waters (effluent) are held within large dyked tailings ponds. Toward testing viable options for reclamation, various hummock-wetlands systems have been constructed; in addition, natural wetlands (inhabited by obligate wetland plant species) have become established as a result of seeping of the effluents held within the large dyked ponds. Vegetation surveys conducted on and around the industrial site revealed that the constructed wetlands associated with the dyke drainage (effluent treated with phosphorous) and consolidated tails (CT; effluent treated with gypsum) had low biodiversity and were not invaded by many aquatic plants. Although the natural wetland was also not invaded by many aquatic species, it was found to be as diverse as the reference wetlands (i.e. off-site wetlands not exposed to the effluents). Exposure to oil sands effluents had an inhibitory effect on the germination (percent and/or rate) of several plant species (tomato, clover, wheat, rye, pea, reed canary grass, loblolly pine) clover and tomato seed germination were most affected. Two treatments in particular (effluents from the natural on-site wetland and the CT constructed wetland), delayed germination, and also led to reduced fresh weight of seedlings of tomato, wheat, clover and loblolly pine. The osmolarities of the effluents associated with the natural on-site wetland and CT constructed wetland were 712 and 728 mOs/kg, respectively; substituting these effluents with solutions of polyethylene glycol of the same osmotic potentials had a greater inhibitory effect on germination rate. The negative effects of the effluents on seed germination may account for the paucity of aquatic species that invaded the oil sands impacted wetlands. This factor will also be critical in determining the long-term feasibility of hummock-wetland systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent modeling studies indicate that soil erosion and terrestrial sedimentation may establish ecosystem disequilibria that promote carbon (C) sequestration within the biosphere. Movement of upland eroded soil into wetland systems with high net primary productivity may represent the greatest increase in storage capacity potential for C sequestration. The capacity of wetland systems to capture sediments and build up areas of deposition has been documented as well as the ability of these ecosystems to store substantial amounts of C. The purpose of our work was to assess rates of sediment deposition and C storage in a wetland site adjacent to a small first-order stream that drains an agricultural area. The soils of the wetland site consist of a histosol buried by sediments from the agricultural area. Samples of deposited sediments in the riparian zone were collected in 5 cm increments and the concentration of Cs-137 was used to determine the 1964 and 1954 deposition layers. Agricultural activity in the watershed has caused increased sediment deposition to the wetland. The recent upland sediment is highly enriched in organic matter indicating that large amounts of organic C have been sequestered within this zone of sediment deposition. Rates of sequestration are much higher than rates that have occurred over the pre-modern history of the wetland. These data indicate the increased sedimentation rates in the wetland ecosystem are associated with increased C sequestration rates. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Temperate forests can contain large numbers of wetlands located in areas of low relief and poor drainage. These wetlands can make a large contribution to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) load of streams and rivers draining the forests, as well as the exchange of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. We studied the carbon budget of a small wetland, located in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada. The study wetland was the Pine Marten Brook site, a poor fen draining a mixed hardwood-softwood forest. We studied the loss of DOC from the wetland via the outlet stream from 1990 to 1999 and related this to climatic and hydrologic variables. We added the DOC export information to information from a previously published model describing CH4 and CO2 fluxes from the wetland as a function of precipitation and temperature, and generated a new synthesis of the major C losses from the wetland. We show that current annual C losses from this wetland amount to 0.6% of its total C mass. We then predicted that under climate changes caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 expected between 2040 and 2050, total C loss from the wetland will almost double to 1.1% of total biomass. This may convert this wetland from what we assume is currently a passive C storage area to an active source of greenhouse gases, Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are expected to increase photosynthetic rates Of C-3 tree species, but it is uncertain whether this will result in an increase in wetland seedling productivity. Separate short-term experiments (12 and 17 weeks) were performed on two wetland tree species, Taxodium distichum and Acer rubrum, to determine if elevated CO2 would influence the biomass responses of seedlings to flooding. T. distichum were grown in replicate glasshouses (n = 2) at CO2 concentrations of 350 or 700 ppm, and A. rubrum were grown in growth chambers at CO2 concentrations of 422 or 722 ppm. Both species were grown from seed. The elevated CO2 treatment was crossed with two water table treatments, flooded and non-flooded. Elevated CO2 increased leaf-level photosynthesis, whole-plant photosynthesis, and trunk diameter of T. distichum in both flooding treatments, but did not increase biomass of T. distichum or A. rubrum. Flooding severely reduced biomass, height, and leaf area of both T. distichum and A. rubrum. Our results suggest that the absence of a CO2-induced increase in growth may have been due to an 02 limitation on root production even though there was a relatively deep (similar to10 cm) aerobic soil surface in the non-flooded treatment.

AB Results of long-term field studies of wetlands in four different hydrogeologic and climatic settings in the United States indicate that each has considerably different sources of water, which affects their response to climate variability and land-use practices. A fen wetland in New Hampshire is supplied almost entirely by ground water that originates as seepage from Mirror Lake; therefore, stream discharge from the fen closely follows the pattern of Mirror Lake stage fluctuations. A fen wetland in northern Minnesota is supplied largely by discharge from a regional ground-water flow system that has its recharge area 1 to 2 kin to the east. Because of the size of this wetland's ground-water watershed, stream discharge from the fen has little variability. A prairie-pothole wetland in North Dakota receives more than 90 percent of its water from precipitation and loses more than 90 percent of its water to evapotranspiration, resulting in highly variable seasonal and annual water levels. A wetland in the sandhills of Nebraska lies in a regional ground-water flow field that extends for tens of kilometers and that contains numerous lakes and wetlands. The wetland receives water that moves through the ground-water system from the upgradient lakes and from ground water in local flow systems that are recharged between the lakes. The difference in sources of water to these wetlands implies that they would require different techniques to protect their water supply and water quality.

AB At the scale of ecosystems and regions, numbers of nesting long-legged wading birds are often highly variable from year to year, and much of this variation is thought to reflect variation in production or availability of prey animals in wetlands. Based on observations during and following a severe drought in the Florida Everglades (1989-1992), we predicted that large nesting events would be more likely immediately following droughts than at other times. Using a 38-year history of wading bird nesting events in the Florida Everglades, we tested the hypothesis that "supranormal" annual nesting events (numbers of nests >1 standard deviation above the long-term mean) would occur more frequently during the period of up to two years after severe droughts (stages <1 standard deviation below the mean) than after non-drought years. Within this database, we identified 8 supranormal events and 8 severe droughts; 7 of the nesting events occurred immediately after a drought, and 7 of the droughts were followed by a supranormal nesting event. There was a highly significant association between the two types of events. Because many studies suggest that wading bird reproduction is food-limited, this result implies that post-drought conditions somehow result in exceptional productivity and/or availability of small fishes and macroinvertebrates. We propose two biological mechanisms for this pattern and suggest that rare, severe droughts in the Everglades are a forcing function for wading bird population cycles and large-scale movements through the action of pulsed productivity in the aquatic food,veb.

AB Although relationships of birds to patch a-rea and habitat characteristics have been dominant themes in avian ecology over the past few decades, relatively little is known about these relationships in wetland-dominated landscapes of the Great Lakes coastline. During 1997 and 1998, we surveyed birds and measured habitat characteristics along transects in wet meadows associated with the northern Lake Huron shoreline (NLHS) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Using a suite of multivariate techniques, we related abundance and presence/absence of individual species to wet meadow area and habitat characteristics. Nine species were positively associated with increasing wet meadow area, which underscores the importance of large wetlands to avian conservation in the region. Bird variables also were related to habitat characteristics. Higher values of bird variables were generally associated with a suite of characteristics: more robust and dense grass/sedge vegetation, structural diversity in the horizontal and vertical planes, and increased frequency of willow shrubs. Individual species that require particular aspects of these characteristics for nesting or foraging were associated with principal components containing those aspects. In the NLHS, large wet meadows that possess these characteristics would support the greatest diversity and benefit the majority of species. However, conservation efforts that focus only on these traits will not be sufficient for all species because habitat requirements for some species are very specific (e.g., open water for mallard), and for others, habitat preferences may change from year to year in response to lake-level changes. While our results provide important insights, continued research is needed to further the successful conservation and management of birds in Great Lakes coastal wetlands.

AB This study describes the results of wetland construction projects designed to offset wetland losses authorized under the wetland regulatory program of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including analysis of 391 project files identified in the study period between 1983 and 1994 and 114 field sites. Detailed comparisons of replacement plant communities were made with remnant impacted wetlands when these existed. Most projects in the study were relatively small, impacting less than 46.5 m(2) (500 ft(2)) of wetland. The majority of projects (54.4%) were not in compliance with the Massachusetts wetland regulations for a variety of reasons, including no attempt to build the project (21.9%), insufficient size or hydrology (29.8%), or insufficient cover of wetland plants (2.6%). Many of the projects constructed (64.9%) were smaller than required. The majority of constructed projects involved impacts to forested wetlands (71.1%). Most replication projects were designed to produce scrub/shrub systems (61.4%), but projects actually built produced no wetland (38.6%), wet meadows (36.8%), or some other wetland type (24.5%). The plant communities produced at replication sites differed significantly from the wetlands they were designed to replace in terms of number of species, cover, and species composition. The similarity of the replication site plant communities did not increase between projects that were new and projects up to 12-years old, indicating that impacted plant communities may not be replaced at most sites for many years, if at all. The completeness of the replication plan and the Order of Conditions (permit) affected the likelihood that a project complied with the regulations but not the level of similarity between the replicated and impacted plant communities. Larger projects constructed under variances from the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act were much more carefully designed and were all in compliance with the regulations. However, their plant communities were not similar to those of the impacted wetlands they replaced. Variance projects generally provided replication of water quality and sediment control functions but not of wildlife habitat. The state's goal of no net wetland loss cannot be met unless the regulatory program succeeds in compensating for all authorized wetland impacts.

AB Plant communities of tidal freshwater marshes fluctuate in composition seasonally and among years, but the influence of changes in hydrology on vegetation of these systems has not been examined. We investigated the effects of hydrology on vegetation of tidal freshwater marshes along the Patuxent River in Maryland, USA with a two-year field experiment, a one-year greenhouse experiment, and a seed-bank experiment. In the field experiment, sections of marsh soil and vegetation ("sods") were elevated 10 cm, lowered 10 cm, or placed level with the marsh surface to simulate different hydrologic regimes. In the greenhouse experiment, sods were raised 10 cin above water surface (nonflooded) or flooded by 10 cm of water in tanks continuously, and in two other treatments changed from nonflooded to flooded or vice-versa after the first 35 days. For the seed-bank experiment, soil samples were spread in a 1-cm-thick layer in pans subjected to flooding by 3.5-4 cin of water or nonflooded but moist conditions in the greenhouse, and emerging seedlings counted. We found that lowering marsh sods by 10 cm (i.e., wetter conditions) in the field reduced plant species richness by 26% compared to the sods placed level with the marsh surface, while raising sods by 10 cm (drier conditions) increased richness by 42%. Total stem length of a majority of the most common species, as well as for all species combined, was more than twice as great in raised sods as in lowered sods. We observed similar patterns in richness and total stem length in the greenhouse study, where continuously nonflooded sods had almost twice the richness and 55% greater total stein length as continuously flooded sods. Sods that were flooded initially and then shifted to nonflooded conditions had richness and total stein length similar to the continuously flooded sods, while sods that were nonflooded initially and then flooded had richness and total stem length intermediate to continuously nonflooded and continuously flooded sods. In the field and greenhouse studies, species that are annual or annnual/perennial were more inhibited by flooding than were perennials. In the seedbank experiment, flooding reduced the number of species emerging by 50% and total densities of emerging seedlings by 80% compared to nonflooded conditions. Taken together, the results of the field, greenhouse, and seed-bank studies indicate that 3-10 cm of flooding can significantly reduce seedling recruitment and growth in many plant species of tidal freshwater marshes and result in lower plant diversity. The greenhouse study further indicates that shallow flooding early in the growing season can reduce the abundance of certain species, primarily annuals, for the remainder of the growing season, resulting in a less diverse community. These findings suggest that hydrology is a dominant environmental variable controlling interannual variation in plant species composition of tidal freshwater marshes. Additionally, this study suggests that small increases in frequency and duration of inundation, which might occur due to watershed land-use changes, sea-level rise, or land subsidence, will reduce the diversity of these plant communities.

ID MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; SMALL STREAMS; WETLANDS
AB Small seasonal ponds are abundant in many forest landscapes, yet they remain poorly understood in terms of their response to disturbance of the surrounding upland forest. The potential for such a response is large because of the small size and, hence, high perimeter-to-area ratios of most ponds. High perimeter-to-area ratio may increase the importance of functional connections with the surrounding forest, via exchange of energy, organisms, and materials. To better understand this connection, we studied 19 seasonal ponds across a 100-year chronosequence of single-cohort forests in northern Minnesota. Our objective was to see if there are distinct changes over time in select pond attributes, which may reflect alteration of functional link-ages with the surrounding forest. In 1998 and 1999, we sampled hydroperiod, water depth and chemistry, canopy openness, grass, sedge, shrub, and coarse woody debris cover, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) flux, and macroinvertebrate and amphibian populations. We related these variables to stand age through regression. Stand age explained little variation for most variables. Responsive variables included canopy openness and CPOM flux. Canopy openness, in turn, was related positively to total macroinvertebrate abundance, sensitive taxon richness, and Haliplidae beetle and Physidae snail abundances. Calling wood frogs occurred more frequently under an open canopy and low CPOM flux. An open canopy, which occurs more often over ponds in younger than in older forest, likely results in increases in water and air temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation, all of which may influence resource availability and habitat suitability for some macroinvertebrates and amphibian taxa. Results from our exploratory study suggest that many characteristics of small seasonal ponds are unaffected by harvest of the adjacent upland forest, at least as detected through examination of a chronosequence. However, responsive variables may include several abiotic characteristics that provide mechanistic links to pond foodwebs.

AB We characterized canopy disturbance patterns in a bottomland hardwood forest and identified linkages to tree species characteristics and interannual flooding patterns. We located 116 newly formed canopy gaps created by 136 gapmakers of 13 species. Over 83% of the gapmakers were snapped or uprooted (i.e., windthrow). The probability of any given gapmaker snapping or uprooting differed among years, species, and elevations. Neither wood properties nor diameter were major factors in determining the probability of snapping versus windthrow. Quercus texana, which had individuals with larger diameters-at-breast height than trees of other dominant species, was the most frequent gapmaker. The effects of elevation and flooding on the probability of snap versus windthrow seem to be tempered or amplified by interspecific rooting habits and tree morphology. Across species, windthrow occurred at lower elevations than snaps, and Q. texana and Q. lyrata showed differences in elevation between the two disturbance types. The total amount of area in newly-formed canopy gaps, as well as gap size, was relatively low compared to estimates for other forests. Our results suggest that natural disturbance patterns in bottomland hardwood forests are complex and are affected by the interactions among foreat structure and composition and flooding patterns.

AB We examined the effects of beaver impoundments on the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of two small Appalachian streams, Mountain Run (Somerset County, Pennsylvania) and a tributary to Herrington Creek (Garrett County, Maryland). Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages above the impoundments,were compared with assemblages within the impoundments and 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m below the impoundments. The results of our study indicate that beaver affect both within-impoundment and downstream benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Taxonomic and functional changes in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of the beaver-altered streams were a result of direct (impoundment) and indirect (changes in temperature, water chemistry, plant growth) alterations of the stream environment.

AB Testate amoebae are common inhabitants of moist soils, wetland, and lacustrine habitats. They produce a decay-resistant test, or shell, which can be identified to species in most cases and recovered from sediments in quantities sufficiently large to permit estimation of relative abundance. The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of testate amoeba assemblages as paleoenvironmental and environmental indicators in two Lake Superior coastal wetlands and to determine if morphological variation in four common taxa (Arcella spp., Assulina spp., Centropyxis cassis type, and Nebela tincta-parvula-collaris group) is related to microenvironment. Study localities included ridge-swale wetland systems adjacent to Grand Traverse Bay and Tahquamenon Bay in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Testate amoeba assemblages from 74 microsites were compared with percent moisture, depth to water table, pll, porosity, depth of living moss, and associated moss and vascular plant species. Morphometric analysis (e.g., test length and aperture diameter) was conducted on 25 individuals from at least 10 microsites for each of the four selected taxa. Gradient analysis indicated that testate amoeba assemblages are primarily controlled by substrate moisture and pH, consistent with results from other regions. Transfer functions for pH and substrate moisture were developed using 'jack-knifed' validation procedures. Little relationship was found between microenvironmental parameters and morphological variation in the investigated taxa, except for the Nebela tincta-parvula-collaris group, where test size was significantly correlated with pH (r(2) = 0.68). Results indicate that wetland testate amoeba assemblages in these coastal wetland systems are sensitive environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators that can be used to monitor and reconstruct water-level or pll changes.

AB The faunal composition, richness, and their determinant factors were analyzed in a Mediterranean temporary pond located in NE Spain. The aquatic community was sampled weekly over 7 periods of flooding during 4 years (1996-1999). Composition of the pond community was found to be influenced by duration of the hydroperiod and, secondarily, by seasonality. Insects and crustaceans were the most well-represented types of fauna. The small numbers of species captured over all hydroperiods spend the dry periods in situ or have an important dispersal capacity. Comparison of the faunal composition of several temporary ponds of temperate latitudes confirms the great diversity of faunal groups found in temporary aquatic environments, and this richness is comparable to that found in permanent water bodies. The richness of these temporary ponds is related to flooded surface and to hydroperiod duration. The peculiarity of the fauna of temporary waters, together the deteriorating condition of those habitats, make it necessary for more active policies of preservation to be pursued.

AB Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is an invasive wetland perennial that is thought to threaten the ecological integrity of North American wetlands by forming monotypic stands and altering the diversity of native wetland ecosystems. To determine if purple loosestrife infestation alters aquatic invertebrate communities, the abundance and size distribution of aquatic invertebrates associated with purple loosestrife were quantified during the spring and summer and compared to those within stands of two other commonly occurring emergents, cattail (Typha latifolia) and bulrush (Scirpus acutus). Aquatic invertebrates representing 10 taxa (classes or orders) were collected using four different sampling techniques. Individuals from each taxa were collected in all three vegetation types, although the size of the individuals of some orders was smaller in Lythrum. Measurements of water quality indicated no significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) differences among the three vegetation types, despite the fact that Scirpus tended to be established in deeper water than Lythrum. Results indicate that monotypic stands of purple loosestrife are not lacking in aquatic invertebrates however, because our study was conducted in a mixed vegetation wetland at an intermediate stage of purple loosestrife infestation, our findings may not be representative of more extreme purple loosestrife invasions.

ID REFORESTATION; VALUES
AB The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) originally supported at least 10 million ha of bottomland hardwood (BLH) forests. Many of these forests were wetlands and provided a diversity of values that were not recognized fully until at least one-half of the original forested area had been converted primarily to row-crop agriculture. Efforts to restore these forests have expanded in proportion to growing recognition of their unique values. This paper provides a summary resulting from a survey of BLH afforestation by all agencies and private entities in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states in the LMAV with the most restoration activity and, more specifically, by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service, and state wildlife management agencies, the three entities responsible for approximately 95% of the afforestation in this region. There is a promising trend in the annual increase of BLH afforestation across die LMAV. Approximately 71,000 ha have been planted with BLH species through 1998; however, this represents <1% of the BLH forests that have been lost, and afforestation does not ensure restoration of all ecological functions. No clear choice between planting stocks (bareroot seedlings or direct seeding) or among planting seasons (Fall, Winter, Spring, or Summer) is prevalent among those involved in BLH afforestation. Much of the early afforestation used oaks (Quercus spp.) to accelerate replacement of mast-bearing species. Recently, mixtures of species have been incorporated into afforestation regimes. More light-seeded species and a more diverse component of oak species have been planted to mimic a more natural regeneration process. Successful widescale afforestation is a critical link in restoration of functional BLH ecosystems in this region.

AB Difficulties in accurately calculating evapotranspiration (ET) in wetlands can lead to inaccurate water balances-information important for many compensatory mitigation projects. Simple meteorological methods or off-site ET data often are used to estimate ET, but these approaches do not include potentially important site-specific factors such as plant community, root-zone water levels, and soil properties. The objective of this study was to compare a commonly used meteorological estimate of potential evapotranspiration (PET) with direct measurements of ET (lysimeters and water-table fluctuations) and small-scale rootzone geochemistry in a natural and constructed wetland system. Unlike what has been commonly noted, the results of the study demonstrated that the commonly used Penman combination method of estimating PET underestimated the ET that was measured directly in the natural wetland over most of the growing season. This result is likely due to surface heterogeneity and related roughness effects not included in the simple PET estimate. The meteorological method more closely approximated season-long measured ET rates in the constructed wetland but may overestimate the ET rate late in the growing season. ET rates also were temporally variable in wetlands over a range of time scales because they can be influenced by the relation of the water table to the root zone and the timing of plant senescence. Small-scale geochemical sampling of the shallow root zone was able to provide an independent evaluation of ET rates, supporting the identification of higher ET rates in the natural wetlands and differences in temporal ET rates due to the timing of senescence. These discrepancies illustrate potential problems with extrapolating off-site estimates of ET or single measurements of ET from a site over space or time.

AB In the upper reaches of estuaries, the pulsing of nutrient inputs and salinity occurs on fine temporal and spatial scales. We investigated the supply and exchanges of N, P, and S along a salinity gradient in a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Interactions among nutrients in surface water, sediment porewater, and shoots of the dominant marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora were also examined. The system was characterized by a spatial gradient in nutrient availability, with the low salinity region representing abundant allochthonous nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and minimal sulfur availability. Autochthonous production and consumption of nutrients were most important at the midpoint of the salinity gradient. These patterns were reflected in the N, P, and S content of S. alterniflora over one growing season. This brackish tidal creek system also had a gradient of temporal variability in levels of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. The higher salinity portion experienced the damping effect of waters of more constant nutrient composition, whereas the upper portion of the system was characterized by highly pulsed nutrient availability. Interchanges between nutrient pools were apparent throughout the system. Sediment, and even surface-water, concentrations of nutrients seemed to respond to plant root zone oxidation and uptake and release of nutrients. Porewater biogcochemical processes were linked to surface-water nutrient dynamics as well.

TI Applying survey research methods to account for denied access to
   research sites on private property
SO WETLANDS
LA English

DE environmental survey; access rate; nonresponse bias
ID TRENDS; RATES
AB Needs for environmental information have led to more emphasis on surveys that assess changing environmental conditions. In order to obtain biological, physical, and chemical measures of environmental change, it is critical to obtain repeated access to research sites. Use of established survey methodology can improve access rates to private property in order to visit randomly selected research sites. Surveys initiated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) were conducted in 1995 and 1996 in Eastern North Dakota to monitor environmental conditions in prairie wetlands. These surveys required written permission from landowners to access private property. A summary of survey research methods designed to improve access rates to sites on private property is presented. Approximately 20% of the landowners who granted access did so in response to telephone calls after attempts by mail failed. The data show that a disproportionate number of accessible sites were located on nonagricultural lands, particularly in 1996. Owners of sites where agricultural land abutted wetlands tended to deny access. This may introduce bias in the monitoring data. A weighting class adjustment procedure was applied to account for any nonresponse bias resulting from denied access. This procedure deals with the imbalance from denied access and at least partially returns a balance to the collected data.

AB Salicornia virginica (common pickleweed) is the dominant vascular plant of many saline marshes of the US west coast, yet little is known about seasonal patterns or abiotic factors controlling it. In a southern California salt marsh, quarterly sampling revealed strong seasonal trends, with 2x greater S. virginica biomass in summer than in winter. Tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were highest in winter and lower in spring and summer, suggesting a dilution of nutrients as plants accumulated biomass during the growing season. Despite high sediment nutrient levels in this marsh, an experiment examining N and P effects still found strong S. virginica responses to N applied biweekly for > 1 year. Increases in succulent tissue biomass after N addition were first seen in April 1998 (after fertilization for 11 months); two-fold increases in biomass and the number of branches resulted by the end of the experiment in August 1998. Addition of N increased N concentration in the woody tissues when sampled in August. The N:P ratio increased with N addition beginning in winter (7 months after fertilization began) and continuing through the remainder of the experiment. Effects of P addition were less marked, as adding P did not result in biomass responses; however, it did influence tissue nutrient levels. These amendments increased P concentrations in the woody tissue in August 1998. In contrast to N amendments, which did not affect root nutrient concentrations, P addition led to increases in P content of root tissues in the latter portion of the growing season. These data suggest that increases in nutrients (especially N, but also P) can lead to large changes in S. virginica characteristics even in estuaries with high sediment nutrient levels.

AB Terracing is a relatively new wetland-restoration technique used to convert shallow subtidal bottom to marsh. This method uses existing bottom sediments to form terraces or ridges at marsh elevation. A terrace field is constructed by arranging these ridges in some pattern that maximizes intertidal edge and minimizes fetch between ridges; the intertidal area is planted with marsh vegetation. We examined the habitat value of terracing for fishery species at Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana (USA) in spring and fall 1999 by quantifying and comparing nekton densities in a 9-yr-old terrace field and nearby reference area using a 1-m(2) drop sampler. Decapod crustaceans were more abundant than fishes, composing 62% and 95% of all organisms we collected in spring and fall, respectively. White shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus, daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus accounted for 94% of all crustaceans, whereas 60% of all fishes were gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus. Mean densities of white shrimp (fall), daggerblade grass shrimp, blue crab, and brown shrimp (spring) were significantly greater in terrace marsh than on non-vegetated bottom in the reference pond. Densities of most nekton on non-vegetated bottom were similar in the terrace field and the reference pond, but gulf menhaden and white shrimp had higher densities at terrace pond sites and brown shrimp (spring) were more abundant at reference pond sites. The pattern for biomass was similar to that for density in that the mean biomass of most species was significantly greater at terrace marsh sites than reference pond sites and similar at terrace and reference pond sites. Terrace marsh, however, was not functionally equivalent to natural marsh, as mean densities of daggerblade grass shrimp (fall), brown shrimp (spring), and blue crab and mean biomass of white shrimp (fall), striped mullet Mugil cephalus (spring), and spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus (fall) were greater at reference marsh sites than terrace marsh sites. Using these density and biomass patterns and the percentage of marsh and pond area in the terrace field, we concluded that terrace fields support higher standing crops of most fishery species compared with shallow marsh ponds of similar size. Future restoration projects could include design changes to increase the proportion of marsh in a terrace field and enhance the habitat value of marsh terraces for fishery species.

AB Historically, anthropogenic activities have contributed to the direct loss of wetland area, mostly due to agriculture and urban land uses. Urbanization also indirectly impacts wetlands at a landscape scale through altered wetland hydrology and change in the spatial configuration of wetlands in a watershed. In addition., beaver (Castor canadensis) create and modify wetlands in a landscape. Because of recent increases in urbanization and rising beaver populations, a raster-based geographic information system (GIS) was used to analyze the combined effects of humans and beavers on wetland area and types in the Chickahominy River watershed from 1953 to 1994. Results of the study revealed that 29% of the land changed during the 41-year study period, and wetland conversion constituted 7% of the total change. The major reason for wetland loss was the construction of two large water-supply reservoirs in the watershed, and most of the remaining wetland loss was due to urbanization. Wetland functions vary depending on wetland type, and the results of this study showed that 90% of the change in wetlands from 1953 to 1994 was a result of shifting between wetland types. Beaver-modified wetlands increased 274%, and beaver activity was responsible for 23% of the wetland change.

AB Plant decomposition and litter accumulation are important components of wetland functions, yet they have rarely been evaluated in created wetlands. In this study, eleven 20-yr and six 2-yr-old depressional wetlands, the most common type of created wetlands, were investigated. We measured plant decomposition as mass loss over 507 days for both age classes and litter accumulation as litter (detritus) mass present in the 20-yr-old wetlands. The wetlands were all created via excavation and contained shallow facultative wetland and deeper obligate wetland plant communities that were often dominated by Scirpus cyperinus and Typha latifolia, respectively. In the decomposition study, stems and leaves from each species were harvested from an adjacent 20-yr-old wetland site and placed in separate plastic mesh bags. Bags were deployed in March 1994 and were recovered after 2, 161, 258, 364, and 507 days. In the litter accumulation study, plant litter that accumulated on top of alluvium was harvested in 0.25-m(2) plots adjacent to decomposition bags. Several environmental variables were measured in the 20-yr-old wetlands, including live standing crop biomass (peak aboveground biomass) in 1993 and 1994, nutrient concentrations (in water, soil, and plant tissues), and hydrologic parameters. Decomposition was faster in 20-yr-old wetlands (76% of mass remaining) than in 2-yr-old wetlands (85%) but was well below most literature estimates for comparable species in natural wetlands (53%). Decomposition of S. cyperinus was slower than that for T. latifolia in all 17 wetlands. In the 20-yr-old wetlands, hydrologic variables were important for decomposition of both species. Masses of litter that accumulated during the 20 years since excavation were greater among facultative wetland (764 g/m(2)) than in obligate wetland communities (368 g/m(2)). Accumulated litter mass in the facultative wetland community was positively correlated with the S. cyperinus percentage of total live standing crop biomass. Accumulated litter mass in the obligate wetland community was positively correlated with drawdown duration and litter C:N ratios. Decomposition functions of these wetlands are still developing 20 years after creation.

AB The interaction between plant growth and nutrient availability is an important aspect of vegetation dynamics in wetlands. In this study, seedlings of Typha domingensis were used to assay the nutrient availability of fire-disturbed Florida Everglades soils. Seedlings were planted in soils that had been naturally muck- (MB), surface- (SB), or non-burned (NB) and that showed significant differences in concentrations of inorganic:total phosphorus according to fire severity. After two months of growth, plant height, number of leaves, culm diameter, number of rhizomes, length of rhizomes, live leaf biomass, and above- and belowground biomass were greatest in MB seedlings. In addition, root architecture and biomass allocation were influenced by soil type. Seedlings from NB and SB soils developed thinner roots with numerous root hairs and had higher percentages of below-ground biomass. In contrast, seedlings grown in muck-burned soils developed large rhizomes in addition to thicker, hairless roots while allocating proportionally more biomass to aboveground parts. Tissue nutrient analyses showed that both experimental and field-harvested plants grown in MB soils contained significantly more phosphorus than plants from SB or NB soils. Typha domingensis has displaced plant communities in areas of the Everglades that receive nutrient-enriched agricultural runoff. However, this study suggests that establishment and expansion of this species also may occur in overdrained regions of the Everglades where muck fires are a frequent occurrence. In addition to creating an opening in the landscape, muck fires increase the bioavailability of soil phosphorus, thus providing a competitive advantage for T. domingensis.

AB As in many areas of western North America, flood irrigation for hay production has created many wetlands in the Laramie Basin, Wyoming. Since the early 1900s, water from mountain snowmelt has reached wetlands via ditches and as interflow and ground water percolating from flooded fields and unlined ditches. Such systems are viewed as inefficient for irrigation and other human uses because they reduce the volume and increase the salinity of downstream flows. Increasing irrigation efficiency by lining ditches or installing sprinklers would decrease wetland habitat, but such effects are seldom considered. To assess potential impacts of increased irrigation efficiency, we determined how flood irrigation affects the hydrology and types of wetlands in the Laramie Basin. For 74 wetlands with 80 total inflows, just 14% of inflows were as surface flow from natural stream channels. In contrast, 65% of inflows were directly from irrigation: 30% as surface flow from ditches and 35% as interflow percolating from ditches and irrigated fields. Fifteen percent of inflows were as surface flow from other wetlands, and 6% of inflows were from ground water with unknown recharge source (probably either natural streams or irrigation). In this year of high water availability (1999), wetlands receiving surface water generally were fresh or oligosaline regardless of whether that flow was from natural streams, other wetlands, or ditches (mean +/- 1 SD = 3.28 +/- 5.07 mS/cm, median = 1.60, range 0.07-22.10). In contrast, wetlands receiving water as interflow percolating from ditches or irrigated fields, or as ground water with unknown recharge source, were more likely to have conductivities of mesosaline or higher (mean +/- 1 SD = 22.45 +/- 32.71 mS/cm, median = 9.08, range 0.60-112.00). Conductivity of surface water in the 74 wetlands (mS/cm) ranged from fresh (0.07) to hypersaline (112.00), with a mean of 10.89 +/- 22.80 (SD) and median of 2.60; this range of salinity corresponds to substantial variation in wetland community structure. In the Laramie Basin and similar areas, flood irrigation is critical to the existence, hydrology, and community types of most wetlands, and these effects should be considered in plans to increase irrigation efficiency.

AB Sediment cores, representing a range of watershed characteristics and anthropogenic impacts, were collected in 11 subalpine marshes in the Lake Tahoe basin, USA and vicinity in order to trace the effect of anthropogenic impacts on sedimentation and sediment accumulation rates. Cores were Pb-210-dated using a CRS model, and these data were used to calculate sedimentation rates and sediment accumulation rates, which were compared with environmental variables. Age-depth profiles indicated that sedimentation rates changed at different times in different marshes, and we separated sediment cores into two parts to show sediment characteristic and sediment-accumulation-rate changes. Ranges of dry mass accumulation rates and sedimentation rates were 0.081-1.356 kg m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.94-4.64 mm yr(-1) in the upper core and 0.094-0.563 kg m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.57-1.75 mm yr(-1) in the lower core. In general, the cores showed recent increases in sediment accumulation rates. Species composition was related to water quality, with the dominant species changing in a predictable series with decreasing water quality: Nuphar, Nuphar and Carex/Scirpus, Eleocharis, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, and Chara. The effect of a rough road used for timber transport was observed as the change of sediment accumulation rates in Upper Grass Lake. Sediment accumulation rates since the improvement of the rough road decreased to ca. 80 % of those prior to the improvement. Road-salt use was related to relatively high water cation concentrations and conductivity in Meyers Grade Marsh adjacent to Hwy 50. Increased lead accumulation rates and concentrations in more recent sediments at Meyers Grade Marsh and Snow Creel, reflect the increasing use of fossil fueled vehicles in this region. Urbanization and animal farming were related to increased N and P concentrations in marsh water. The number of exotic plant species within a marsh was highly correlated with water quality and C and N accumulation rates. This study showed that 8 of the 11 marshes studied are in relatively undisturbed condition, while the remaining 3 have been heavily impacted. Urbanization and increased recreation facilities, and activities are important anthropogenic impacts on subalpine marshes. This study suggests that pristine subalpine marshes be protected from increasing human activities and that marshes impacted by rough roads can be restored to pristine conditions.

AB Black willow (Salix nigra) is a well-known pioneer species of disturbed riparian areas. It competes for nutrients, light, and water, but it may also act as a "nurse" crop, providing shelter for other species from high light and temperature; so, the overall effect on species planted under a willow canopy could be positive or negative. This experiment examined the response of container-grown seedlings of four tree species outplanted into three habitats: 1) an existing willow stand, 2) a similar habitat, but with the willow canopy removed, and 3) an adjacent grass-dominated area free of willow. After three years, survival rates of overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), and water hickory (Carya aquatica) were not reduced under the willow canopy relative to the other two treatments. Laurel oak (Q. laurifolia) was killed by several floods during the first growing season. Height of baldcypress seedlings planted under a willow canopy was less than for seedlings where the willow had been removed. Water hickory and overcup oak height were not affected by the willow canopy. Elevation of the planting sites, indicating probable soil wetness, was a good indicator of survival when used in conjunction with the species flood-tolerance. The existing willow stand was not detrimental to survival of three of the outplanted tree species. Thus, willow removal is unnecessary for successful outplanting, saving time and money.

AB Portions of the northern Everglades of Florida, USA have become enriched with phosphorous and have responded with increased plant productivity and increased litter decomposition rates. Many lakes respond to eutrophication with decreased redox potential in sediments. The objective of this study was to determine if there were differences in soil redox potential along a nutrient-enrichment gradient in the Everglades marshes. We measured redox potential, the depth at which iron reduction occurs as determined by steel rod oxidation, and the oxidation state of exchangeable iron along the gradient. The results of redox potentials at fixed depths, redox-potential profiles, and rusting of steel rods all suggest that iron-reducing conditions exist beneath the surface of the sediment in both the unenriched and enriched areas and that differences between the enriched, cattail-invaded area and the unenriched sawgrass areas are either not significant or, in the case of the redox profiles from 20- to 40-cm depth in the soil, of borderline significance and small magnitude (< about 50 mV). The lack of large differences also suggests that reduction of the soil redox potential by eutrophication is not a significant factor influencing the competition between sawgrass and the invading cattail or other biogeochemical differences that have been observed along this gradient.

ID CYLINDRICAL PIEZOMETERS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; HYDROLOGY; PEATLAND
AB Standpipe piezometers are often used in wetland hydrologic studies for measuring pore-water pressures and, therefore, hydraulic heads. Here, we consider the errors associated with the use of simple standpipe piezometers in wetland soils. The performance of two typical piezometer designs was assessed. Rather than measure the performance of the piezometer designs in the field, we modelled their response to computer-generated changes in pore-water pressures for three 'model' floodplain soils. We showed that for some piezometer design/soil-type combinations, standpipe piezometers can be in considerable error. Greatest errors were found where the less efficient of the two piezometer designs (standpipe inside diameter = 5 cm, outside diameter of intake = 5.6 cm, intake length = 5 cm) was in a poorly permeable silt deposit (hydraulic conductivity = 6 cm d(-1)) overlain by a permeable sand (hydraulic conductivity = 210 cm d(-1)). If undetected, these errors could lead wetland researchers and/or consultants to make erroneous conclusions about both patterns and rates of ground-water flow in wetland soils. In field investigations, we recommend that selective use is made of rapidly responding piezometers, such as closed hydraulic piezometers, so that the performance of standpipe piezometers can be assessed.

AB The extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of Dasiphora floribunda was measured in 8 calcareous wetlands in eastern New York State, USA. Environmental parameters (pH, conductivity, water-table depth, soil moisture, soil organic matter, soil NH4+, soil available P, and porewater DIP) varied among wetlands. Soil available P was relatively low and ranged from 2.52 to 15.74 mg-P gdw(-1) in all 8 wetlands. Contrary to expectation, the extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda did not vary among calcareous wetlands of different soil phosphorus or moisture status. Mycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda ranged from 66.7 to 91.7%, with an average of 78.1 +/- 7.7%. Although environmental parameters were only measured once, these results suggest that soil available P and soil moisture, used to predict variation of endomycorrhizal colonization of other wetland plants, are not useful for predicting the extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda. We propose that calcareous wetlands in eastern New York are an endpoint on a continuum of wetland types where P availability is so low that variation of P status among calcareous wetlands is not ecologically significant in the regulation of endomycorrhizal colonization.

AB The Trinity River Mitigation Bank was proposed to develop and use a mature, contiguous, diverse riparian corridor along the West Fork of the Trinity River near Dallas, Texas, USA. In the proposed wetland design, water would be diverted from Walker Creek as necessary to maintain wetland function. Therefore, assessment of the magnitude and continuity of the flow from Walker Creek was paramount to successful wetland operation. The Soil and Water Assessment (SWAT) model was used to assess whether the sustained flow (storm flow and base flow) from the Walker Creek Basin could maintain the proposed bottomland wetland ecosystem. For this study, SWAT was modified to allow ponded water within the prescribed wetland to interact with the soil profile and the shallow aquifer. The water budget was prepared for the wetland based on a three-step process. First, data required to run the model on Walker Creek, including soils, topographic, land-use, and daily weather data were assembled. Next, data required to validate the model were obtained. Since stream flow was not available at the proposed site, flow from a nearby watershed with similar soils, land use and topography were used. In the final step, the model was run for 14 years and compared to the measured water balance at the nearby watershed. The model results indicate that the wetland should be at or above 85 percent capacity over 60 percent of the time. The wetland did not dry up during the entire simulated time period (14 years) and reached 40 percent capacity less than one percent of the time during the simulation period. The advantages of the continuous simulation approach used in this study include (1) validation of wetland function (hydroperiod, soil water storage, plant water uptake) over a range of climatic conditions and (2) the ability to assess the long-term. impact of land-use and management changes.

   Potential role of seed banks

AB The composition of seed banks of areas on the drained Kissimmee River floodplain (Florida, USA) that are currently pasture and formerly had been wet prairie, broadleaf marsh, and wetland shrub communities was compared to that of seed banks of areas that have extant stands of these communities. The species composition of the seed banks of existing wet prairie and former wet prairie sites were the most similar, with a Jaccard index of similarity of 55. Existing and former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub communities had Jaccard indices of 38 and 19, respectively. Although existing and former wet prairie seed banks had nearly the same species richness, species richness at former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites was higher than at existing sites. Mean total seed densities were similar in existing and former wet prairies (700 to 800 seeds m(2)). However, seed densities in former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites were significantly greater than in comparable existing communities (>4,900 seeds m(2) at former sites versus 200 to 300 in existing communities). The higher seed densities in former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites was due to over 4,000 seeds m(2) of Juncus effusus in their seed banks. Half of the species that characterize wet prairies were found in the seed banks at former and existing wet prairie sites. At existing broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites, most of the characteristic species were found in their seed banks. However, only one characteristic broadleaf species was found in the seed banks of the former broadleaf marsh sites, and no characteristic wetland shrub species were found in the seed banks of the former wetland shrub sites. The seeds of only two non-indigenous species were found in the seed banks of former wetland communities at very low densities. For all three vegetation types, but particularly for the broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites, re-establishment of the former vegetation on the restored floodplain will require propagule dispersal from off-site sources.

AB Conflicting interpretations of the negative impacts of invasive species can result if inconsistent measures are used among studies or sites in defining the dominance of these species relative to the communities they invade. Such conflicts surround the case of Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife). a widespread exotic wetland perennial. We describe here a 1999 study in which we quantified stand characteristics of L. salicaria and associated vegetation in arrays of 30 1-m(2) plots in each of five wet meadows in Connecticut, USA. We explored linear and non-linear relationships of above-ground plant biomass. stem density, and indices of species richness, diversity, and composition to gradients of L. salicaria dominance, including stem density, percent cover, and biomass. Species richness, other diversity metrics, and stem density of other species were not significantly correlated with the density or percent cover of L. salicaria stems. The relative importance values (number of quadrats in which they were found) of co-occurring species in low-density L. salicaria quadrats were significantly correlated with their relative importance in high-density L. salicaria quadrats, indicating that only modest shifts in abundance occurred as L. salicaria increased in density. No individual species were consistently associated with or repelled by the presence of L. salicaria across sites. In contrast to density and diversity features, however, the total biomass of species other than L. salicaria was significantly, negatively correlated with the total biomass of L. salicaria at each site surveyed. Lythrum salicaria in pure, dense stands maintained a greater above-ground standing biomass on invaded sites than uninvaded vegetation of similar physiognomy. This study demonstrates that hypotheses about L. salicaria effects can vary depending upon the ecological metric that is examined. Where one-time, correlative studies are the most feasible option, data taken on a range of metrics-especially biomass-should be taken to inform us about mechanisms by which L. salicaria invades and predominates in wetlands.

AB This paper describes a study of nutrient dynamics in 17 tidal and non-tidal freshwater riverine wetlands in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Maryland (USA). The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationships between nutrient cycling processes in riverine wetlands that were geographically separated, that were dominated by different types of vegetation, and that had different hydrodynamics We also compared restored and natural riverine wetlands. The results showed distinct differences in interstitial water chemistry between the sites in Maryland and Europe. No such regional differences were found in the soil variables, except for soil phosphorus, which was higher in The Netherlands. Soil organic matte, total nitrogen and phosphorus content, and bulk density were higher in tidal freshwater wetland soils. Forested wetland soils had higher organic matter and total nitrogen and lower bulk density and total phosphorus than soils from wetlands dominated by herbaceous species. Restored wetlands had lower soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen and phosphorus than similar types of natural riverine wetlands. There were no differences in nutrient-related process rates nor plant nutrient concentrations in tidal versus non-tidal riverine wetlands. Lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in plants at the restored sites suggest that nutrient uptake by vegetation may be poorly coupled to rates of nutrient cycling during early stages of vegetation development. A principal components analysis of the data identified groupings of soil and water variables that were similar to those that had been previously identified when we applied the same methods to peatlands that were also geographically widely separated. Results of the study demonstrate that the techniques that we have been using are robust and repeatable. They are especially useful for making general comparisons of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling when there are limitations on the number of wetland that can be sampled. The approach that we have developed may also be used to calibrate and refine nutrient cycling models that are incorporated into wetland assessment procedures.

AB We evaluated the use of macroinvertebrates as a potential tool to identify dry and intensively farmed temporary and seasonal wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region. The techniques we designed and evaluated used the dried remains of invertebrates or their egg banks in soils as indicators of wetlands. For both the dried remains of invertebrates and their egg banks, we weighted each taxon according to its affinity for wetlands or uplands. Our study clearly demonstrated that shells, exoskeletons, head capsules, eggs, and other remains of macroinvertebrates can be used to identify wetlands, even when they are dry, intensively farmed, and difficult to identify as wetlands using standard criteria (i.e., hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils). Although both dried remains and egg banks identified wetlands, the combination was more useful, especially for identifying drained or filled wetlands. We also evaluated the use of coarse taxonomic groupings to stimulate use of the technique by nonspecialists and obtained satisfactory results in most situations.

TI Soil development in phosphate-mined created wetlands of Florida, USA
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE organic matter accumulation; C : N ratio; Mehlich 3 available nutrients;
   wetland age; soil compaction
AB Soil characteristics of a wide variety of created wetlands were compared to those of native wetlands in phosphate-mined areas from central and north Florida, USA. Criteria selected for evaluation of soil samples from 184 sites included soil compaction, bulk density, organic matter (carbon) and nitrogen content, C:N ratio, and available and total nutrient contents. Organic matter accumulation, one of the indicators of a functional wetland, increased across transects going from uplands toward the center of the wetlands, and with wetland age. The organic matter accumulation rate in the AO and Al horizons was 320 g m(2) yr(-1). Native wetlands had significantly greater organic matter accumulation, both in the litter and mineral soil surface. The C:N ratio of the soil organic matter decreased with created wetland age and approached values commonly found in wetland soils (15-25). Bulk density decreased with increasing organic matter content in the created wetlands, and low bulk density soils appeared to support better vegetative growth. Based on the above-mentioned parameters, reclaimed wetlands are slowly developing into "typical" wetlands; the rate of development could possibly be increased by minimizing soil compaction, incorporation of organic matter, or by fertilization.

TI Effects of road salt and Phragmites australis invasion on the vegetation
   of a western Massachusetts calcareous lake-basin fen
SO WETLANDS

ID DEICING SALTS; PINHOOK-BOG; EXPANSION; CHEMISTRY; INDIANA; MARSH; WATER;
   MAINE
AB Kampoosa Bog in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, US;A is a 70-ha wetland comprised of calcareous basin fen and red maple swamp bordered, in part, by roads including the Massachusetts Turnpike. High salt concentrations in the ground water (due to the application of deicing salts on the Turnpike) and Phragmites australis colonies appear to be impacting the native vegetation at this site. Sodium and chloride concentrations at Kampoosa Bog are generally below previously published threshold levels for impacting vegetation, although such levels vary by species and in relation to other environmental stress conditions. Giant reed (Phragmites), a salt-tolerant invasive species, invaded the northern portion of the wetland adjacent to the Turnpike and a gas pipeline sometime after they were built in the 1950s. By 1998, Phragmites had formed dense colonies that continued to spread across the wetland, which supports several state-listed rare plant and animal species. High salt concentrations (Na+ > 112 mg/L, Cl- > 54 mg/L) are present up to 300 meters from the Turnpike. Phragmites colonies occur in areas with high and low salt concentrations, and the species abundance is not well-correlated with elevated salt levels. Although high salt concentrations and Phragmites abundance do not seem to produce an interaction effect on the vegetation of the wetland, the graminoid fen community is impacted by both factors separately. We attribute decreases in the abundance of species between invaded and non-invaded areas to the presence of Phragmites. In the graminoid fen, we attribute decreases in both community measures (richness, evenness, and overall cover) and individual species abundances to high salt concentrations.

TI Relationship between hydrology and zonation of freshwater swale wetlands
   on Lower Hatteras Island, North Carolina, USA
SO WETLANDS

   succession; water level fluctuations
ID DYNAMICS
AB Only a few relatively wide barrier islands support shallow freshwater aquifers. Rare, swale wetlands occur on islands where fresh water inundates, at least seasonally, low-lying troughs between interior dunes. Swale wetlands are dominated by emergent vegetation and submerged aquatic vegetation in the deepest areas and by woody shrubs in more shallow al eas. On southern Hatteras Island, wetland shrubs have progressively invaded open water areas over the past 40 years, suggesting a change in hydrologic regime. To determine the relationship between vegetation cover type and length of saturation, water-level fluctuations over time were analyzed to tie boundaries of six wetland cover types to the duration of soil saturation at 20-cm depth. We found that areas dominated by herbaceous vegetation had significantly longer flooding regimes than areas dominated by shrubs (85-95% vs. 12-69% of the growing season, respectively). Only 22-25 cm elevation differences were found to separate emergent marsh from the various shrub cover types, suggesting that lowering the mean water level via drainage has likely been responsible for shrub swamps replacing emergent marsh in swales. Although succession from open water to shrub swamp probably occurs naturally in the absence of drainage through the accumulation of organic matter, natural disturbances such as wildfire and storm-driven surges of saline water would have periodically re-set succession. Therefore, managing for long-term maintenance of freshwater swale wetlands on barrier islands should include (1) eliminating or controlling drainage through constructed ditches, (2) eliminating man-made barriers that prevent the transport of saline water into ponds during hurricanes and nor'easters, and (3) initiating a prescribed burning program to mimic the historic, natural fire regime.

ID SEED-BANK COMPOSITION; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; MARSH; SEDIMENTS; DORMANCY
AB Playas undergo dynamic environmental changes throughout the growing season, resulting in the need for a persistent seed bank for plants to respond to these changes. Therefore, we investigated seasonal germination patterns of species found in seed banks of playa wetlands. We used the seedling-emergence technique to determine recruitment patterns from seed banks of eight playas. In the greenhouse, seed-bank samples were subjected to two treatments, drawdown or flooded, over a 210-day duration divided into seven 30-day time periods. In both treatments, seedling emergence differed among time periods and species hut was similar among playas. Approximately 52% of drawdown seedlings and 44% of seedlings occurring in the flooded treatment germinated in the first 30 days. Plants occurring in playa seed hanks had variable germination strategies. Three patterns for common (>5% occurrence) species were identified in the drawdown treatment: (1) early germinators (those species that germinated rapidly after exposure to treatments with low germination during the remainder of time periods), (2) late germinators (those that germinate after specific environmental conditions have existed for some time), and (3) continuous germinators (those with even germination rates throughout submersion). Two patterns were found for common species in the flooded treatment: (1) early germinators and (2) continuous germinators. Germination throughout the period of suitable environmental conditions was the dominant strategy for persistence in the unpredictable playa environment. With only a few exceptions, species persisting in seed banks of playas do not show germination for all available seeds upon creation of suitable environmental conditions but rather use viable dornmant seeds as a hedge against the unpredictable environment.

AB Great Lakes coastal marshes serve as spawning areas for adult and nurseries for young-of-year fishes, but the capacity of these habitats to facilitate fish reproduction is threatened due to their continued destruction and degradation. In ol der to appreciate the consequences of marsh loss and degradation, we collected fish larvae with icthyoplankton nets during the summers of 1997 and 1998 in three coastal marsh bays in Les Cheneaux, northern Lake Huron. In addition, we obtained several metrics of human activities and local habitat features (vegetation, water temperature, and substrate slope) and evaluated the importance of these metrics in structuring local larval fish assemblages. Our study indicated that local habitat features strongly and directly affected local larval fish assemblages in Les Cheneaux, while human activities did not. However, human activities may have altered local habitats in Les Cheneaux, thus indirectly impacting local larval fish assemblages.

AB Wisconsin has lost approximately 2 million hectares of wetland since statehood (1848). Through the combined efforts of state and federal agencies and private groups focused primarily on wetland restoration for waterfowl habitat management or compensatory mitigation, a fairly substantial gain in wetland area has been achieved. Much of the wetland restoration effort in Wisconsin has occurred on Formerly agricultural lands. However, due to the nature of the past disturbance and possible residual effects not corrected by simply returning surface waters to these lands, there is some question regarding the resultant wetland quality or biological integrity. In an effort aimed at developing tools to measure wetland gains in terms of quality or ecological integrity, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) initiated a study of biological communities on restored wetlands in Wisconsin. In this paper, we report on the community of microcrustaceans and arthropods that can be collected with a plankton net in open water in wetlands. We examined zooplankton community structure in restored wetlands in terms of richness, taxonomic representation, and Daphnia sexual reproduction and related these metrics to attributes on wetlands representing least-disturbed conditions and agriculturally impacted wetlands. We sampled 56 palustrine wetlands distributed across Wisconsin. These wetland sites were categorized as agricultural, least-impacted, and restored (recently withdrawn from agricultural usage). The wetlands were reasonably homogeneous in many ways, so that taxon richness was not correlated with basin origin, presence of adjacent roads, presence or absence of fish, water chemistry, or the size of the open water. We identified a total of 40 taxa. Taxon richness was significantly lower in agricultural sites (average of 3.88 taxa per site) compared to that of least-impacted sites (7.29 taxa) and restored sites (7.21 taxa). Taxon richness of restored sites was significantly correlated with time since restoration. The data indicate that taxon richness changes from a value typical of agricultural sites to the average richness of least-impacted sites in about 6.4 years. The total taxon list for 8 agricultural sites (14 taxa) was significantly smaller than the average value for randomly chosen sets of 8 least-impacted sites (20.4 taxa). Agricultural and least-impacted sites tended to have the same common taxa. Many taxa of chydorid cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods that were rare in least-impacted sites did not occur in the agricultural sites, nor did fairy shrimp occur in agricultural sites. Daphnia populations only produced males in least-impacted and restored sites. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the reduced species richness and lack of sexual reproduction in agricultural wetland sites. Likely factors include eutrophication, turbidity, or chemical contamination. We conclude that restoration of wetland watersheds works. Withdrawal of the watershed from agricultural usage is followed by an increase in taxon richness, and the sites resembled least-impacted sites in about 6-7 years.

AB Activity traps are commonly used to develop abundance indices of aquatic invertebrates and may be deployed with either the funnel parallel to the water surface (horizontal position) or facing down (vertical position). We compared the relative performance of these two positions in terms of numbers of invertebrates captured, species richness of samples, detection rates of specific taxa, and community-level characterizations. Estimates of zooplankton abundance were also compared to quantitative estimates obtained using a water-column sampler. We used a matched-pairs design where 10 pairs of traps (one horizontal, one vertical) were deployed in each of 4 prairie wetlands on 5 dates in 1999. Vertical traps had higher detection rates and captured greater numbers of adult and larval Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Chaoboridae, hydracarina, cladocera, and Copepoda and also produced samples with greater species richness. Horizontal traps captured greater numbers of Amphipoda and Ostracoda and had higher detection rates for these taxa. Estimates of zooplankton abundance with vertical traps also correlated better with quantitative estimates and indicated greater differences between wetlands than horizontal traps. Both traps showed similar relationships among wetlands and changes through time at the community level, but vertical traps were more sensitive to temporal change. Our results indicate that vertical traps outperform horizontal traps and are preferable for obtaining indices of invertebrate abundance.

AB Traditional methods for sampling aquatic macro-invertebrates are very labor-intensive and largely ineffective when attempting to collect Florida applesnails (Pomacea paludosa) from their natural wetland habitats. We found the use of funnel traps an effective alternative that decreased collection time ten-fold and required considerably less labor than throw traps. The funnel traps described herein can be used effectively for collecting applesnails in a variety of wetland habitat types and plant densities, and they may also be effective in catching other wetland organisms (e.g., Kinosternid turtles).

AB Resource managers confronted with preserving ecosystems for prairie wetland birds in fragmented landscapes require landscape studies that direct conservation efforts over broad geographic regions. We investigated the role of local and landscape factors affecting habitat suitability by integrating remotely sensed wetland and land-cover data with wetland bird habitat models. We linked habitat models with locations of easement and fee-title wetlands to evaluate spatial location and extent of protected, suitable habitat. We also simulated impacts of the loss of small wetlands on suitability of larger wetlands for mobile species that use multiple wetlands. Lastly, we evaluated the efficacy of waterfowl habitat programs in preserving suitable habitat for nongame wetland bird species to recommend strategies for maximizing regional landscape connectivity. Regional databases constructed for this study indicate that easement and fee-title tracts encompass 13.9% (1.2 million ha) of land area and protect 19.8% of the wetlands in eastern South Dakota, USA. Proportion of protected wetlands is highest for semi-permanent (32.3%), intermediate for seasonal (25.6%), and lowest for temporary wetlands (15.8%). A stratified, two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select 834 semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands that were surveyed for birds in 1995 and 1996. Logistic analyses indicate that habitat suitability for some species (e.g., Virginia rail, pied-billed grebe) is related to local vegetation conditions within wetlands, while suitability for others (e.g., northern pintail, black tern) is related to landscape structure at larger scales. As a result, unfragmented prairie wetland landscapes (i.e., areas with wetland complexes embedded within upland grasslands) provide habitat for more species than isolated wetlands in tillage fields. Models developed from survey wetlands were used to classify habitat suitability for all semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands in eastern South Dakota. Small wetlands are critical components of the surrounding landscape that influence habitat suitability of larger wetlands. Models used to reclassify suitability of larger remaining wetlands after small wetlands (<0.5 ha) were removed indicate that species most vulnerable to loss of small wetlands are vagile species that exploit resources over broad spatial scales. Number of wetlands suitable for northern pintails, a mobile species that uses multiple wetlands within a season, decreased 20.7% when wetlands <0.5 ha were removed. Historic paradigms dictating waterfowl habitat protection efforts also have conserved habitat for nongame bird species. Modern paradigms that acknowledge the importance of small shallow wetlands to breeding waterfowl have shifted the focus of protection towards preserving habitat for species that occupy more abundant seasonal wetlands. Cessation of protection efforts would result in further fragmentation of regional wetland landscapes. We recommend that wetlands be acquired not only to consolidate suitable habitat within protected core areas but also to ensure that core areas coalesce to preserve connectivity among regional wetland landscapes.

AB Woody debris is an ecologically important resource in upland forests and stream ecosystems. Although much is known about invertebrate-woody debris interactions in forests and streams, little information exists for forested wetlands. In this study, invertebrates associated with woody debris in a Southeastern U. S, forested floodplain are described and factors that shape community structure are examined. Woody debris samples were collected during two wet (March 1998 and 1999) and one dry period (August 1998) from a bottomland hardwood wetland along the Coosawhatchie River, South Carolina, USA. During wet period collections, both submersed and floating woody debris were collected. Invertebrate richness, density? and arthropod standing-stock biomass were compared among sampling periods (wet and dry), between floating and submersed wood, and among woody debris decay classes. Most invertebrate richness and arthropod biomass was associated with wood collected during wet periods. However, the non-aquatic rather than aquatic arthropods were the most significant component of the overall community structure. Floating woody debris was a "hot spot" for invertebrate richness and arthropod biomass. Increased invertebrate richness was also associated with well-decayed wood. Invertebrates were classified based on temporal use of woody debris and included perennial residents, seasonal colonizers, and seasonal refugees. Overall findings suggest that woody debris is an important resource for invertebrates, and wood-associated invertebrates (especially non-aquatics) need to be considered when studying the diversity and function of forested wetlands.

AB Bird species richness and individual species densities were measured in wetland complexes in 1998. These values were then related to habitat variables within the complexes and to area of wetland habitat in the surrounding landscape. The percentage of wetland area within a complex that was covered with emergent vegetation and the total area of wetland habitat in the 3 km surrounding each complex were significant predictors of species richness. A perimeter-to-area ratio was the most frequently selected variable for inclusion in species-density models, being selected for 8 of 15 models. Five species' densities were related to the percentage of the wetland area that was covered by emergent vegetation, and 4 densities were related to the area covered by weak-stemmed wet-meadow vegetation. Densities of 5 species, as well as the overall species richness, were associated with a measure of the amount of wetland habitat within a 3-km buffer surrounding the wetland complexes. This indicates that the presence and abundance of some wetland bird species may be influenced by the amount of wetland habitat nearby. Thus, programs that encourage restoration of tracts of land that contain multiple wetland basins should be emphasized to maximize benefits to the wetland bird community.

AB We investigated diving beetle (Dytiscidae) assemblages in twelve wetlands in an agricultural landscape in southeastern Sweden. Beetles were trapped in wetlands that varied in permanence (temporary or permanent), area (25 to 4,800 m(2)), age (11 to >50 yr), and shading (open to wooded surroundings). Our objective was to determine if those environmental factors are important in structuring the local assemblages of diving beetles and how the combination of different types of wetlands influence the diversity of diving beetles in a landscape. Generally, species-area relationships were weak, and shaded wetlands, both permanent and temporary, of intermediate size (240-1,100 m(2)) had the highest richness after a rarefaction analysis. It was not possible to discern a certain type of wetland where diversity was highest (measured by index cu and Shannon-Wiener's index), although, again, intermediate sized wetlands did tend to be more diverse than others. Similarities in species compositions were highest among environmentally similar wetlands, and assemblage structure differed substantially between different types of wetlands. Results of ordination (CCA) and variance partitioning revealed that permanence and degree of shading were the most important factors in structuring assemblages. Our findings imply that high diversity of the diving beetles depends on the number of wetland types represented in a landscape. It is possible to achieve high diversity in a small area by combining permanent and temporary wetlands, as well as many age and successional stages, located in wooded and open environments.

AB Despite a national focus on saving wetland systems in the U.S., evaluations of wetland resources and management outcomes have been limited. A fifty-state survey of wetland managers was conducted in order to collect information on (1) wetland resources, (2) management actions taken, and (3) management impact on the resources (wetlands). An overview of the general status of state knowledge of the quantity and quality of their wetland resources is presented. Results indicate that most states have a rough estimate of the resources and most have wetland conservation plans and intend to develop better databases of wetland resources. However, few states track management actions relevant to wetlands and fewer have any idea of the success or impact of past management actions. The ability to assess program effectiveness is key to implementing adaptive management frameworks. A number of lessons learned suggest a basic framework for future wetland management that includes state planning, better quantification (mapping) of wetlands, development of methods to measure wetland quality, and tracking of wetland management actions and outcomes. This framework could also be used as an outline for the development of a mon adaptive approach to wetland management.

AB Created ponds were built as an experiment in mitigating the loss of a wetland to construction. We monitored amphibian breeding population sizes and juvenile recruitment at these "created ponds" for 8.5 years and compared the populations to those observed at the original wetland, Sun Bay (less than or equal to 600 m from the created ponds), and at an undisturbed reference wetland, Rainbow Bay. Some amphibians continued breeding migrations to Sun Bay even after it was filled with soil. Few of the anuran colonists of the created ponds had been previously captured at Sun Bay, but many of the salamander colonists had been collected. The created ponds became permanent, whereas Sun Bay and Rainbow Bay were temporary ponds. Juveniles of two salamander species and 10 species of frogs and toads metamorphosed and emigrated from the created ponds during the study. By the final years of the study, the community structure of adult and juvenile amphibians differed among the three created ponds, as well as between these ponds and the prior amphibian community at the filled wetland and the contemporaneous community at the reference wetland. Mean size at metamorphosis was smaller at the created ponds than at the reference site for two species of frogs, whereas the opposite was true for two salamanders. We conclude that the created ponds provided partial mitigation for the loss of the natural amphibian breeding habitat. Differences between the created ponds and the natural wetlands were likely related to differences in their hydrologic regimes, size, substrates, vegetation, and surrounding terrestrial habitats and to the limited availability of colonists of some species.

AB Despite sedimentation being recognized as a very important process in wetlands, very little is known about its dynamics. This study analyzed sedimentation on a short-term scale in the semiarid floodplain wetland Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park (central Spain). In monthly sampling intervals during 1997 and 1998, we measured seasonal and spatial sedimentation patterns of total solids, organic and mineral matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus using sediment traps. The highest mean mass accumulation rates were obtained at the wetland-input site (135 +/- 57 g m(-2) d(-1)), but a decrease in sedimentation rates was noted with increasing distance from the inflow (49 +/- 39 g m(-2) d(-1) in the terminal zone of the wetland). Flow and water level explained only 13% of variance in sedimentation, The sedimentation patterns presented clear seasonality, coinciding with the period of vegetation growth. There existed a marked spatial heterogeneity in sedimentation that can be attributed to differences in vegetative cover. In vegetated areas, sedimentation of solids was related with nutrient deposition coming from detritus. Sedimentation of mineral matter dominated over the organic fraction. Autochthonous material comprised a very important fraction of accumulated sediment (between 31-57% of mineral matter and 45-65% of organic matter). Sedimentation of autochthonous total phosphorus made up about 90% of total settling phosphorus. Reed (Phragmites australis) and sawgrass (Cladium mariscus) plant cover significantly explained sedimentation of organic matter in the wetland (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.57, respectively). The contribution of phytoplankton primary productivity to total organic carbon sedimentation was negligible and observed only at the deeper sampling stations. The autochthonous mineral matter of the settling seston may originate either from primary precipitation of endogenic calcite and/or rapid mineralization of organic matter on the sediment surface. Accretion rates were very high (1.61-3.87 cm yr(-1)), suggesting that the wetland will silt up within the next century if present rates are maintained. Thus, sedimentation dynamics must be involved in management strategies in order to conserve important wetlands.

AB Ground-water seeps in the Catskill Mountains are important water sources for streams and often have different chemistry than nearby surface water. Many studies have shown correlations between water chemistry and plant species composition in wetlands, but there are no such studies in the Catskill Mountain ground-water seeps. The objective of this study was to identify the chemical and physical environmental variables that most strongly influence plant species composition in seeps. Environmental variables and plant species abundance were measured at 33 seeps. TWo-way INdicator SPecies ANalysis with analysis of variance and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that plant species composition is determined primarily by water depth and alkalinity/acidity complex gradients. Growing season changes in water chemistry were not shown to influence the plant community.

TI Fire, mowing, and hand-removal of woody species in restoring a native

AB The invasion of prairies by woody species is a worldwide conservation concern. Fire is frequently used to inhibit this invasion. However, there is little documentation of the effect of fire in wetland prairies, which are also threatened with encroachment of woody species. The present study investigated wetland species responses to experimental burning, hand-removal of woody species, and mowing with removal of cut material. The possible ecological mechanisms responsible for individualistic responses of species, including direct mortality, ability to resprout, and release from competition are considered. We also evaluated these treatments as tools for meeting restoration objectives of reducing the abundance of woody species, reducing or preventing spread of non-native pest species, and increasing or at least maintaining native species' abundance. After two years of treatments (1994 and 1996) three patterns emerged.
   1) Woody species: Burning and hand-removal caused the greatest reductions in cover of woody species. Mowing with removal of cut material, however, did not reduce the cover of woody species compared to controls. As woody plant cover decreased, plant mortality increased, indicating that treatments influenced woody plant cover at least partially through mortality.
   2) Native herbaceous species: Burning significantly decreased inflorescence production of Deschampsia cespitosa, the dominant wetland prairie grass. In contrast, burning, along with mowing, significantly increased flowering of Juncus tenuis. Flowering and cover of all native graminoids combined, however, showed no significant responses to treatments. Burning and hand-removal significantly promoted the cover of native forbs as a group, with Lotus purshiana and Veronica scutellata showing the greatest increases. 3) Non-native herbaceous species: Burning and hand-removal significantly reduced the cover of non-native forbs as a group and particularly reduced the cover of Hypericum perforatum. The number of inflorescences of nonnative grasses (Holcus lanatus and Anthoxanthum odoratum) increased with hand-removal and mowing. Overall, no treatment was clearly superior in fulfilling the restoration objectives. Burning was effective in reducing woody cover and did not promote abundance of non-native herbaceous species. Burning, however, reduced the flowering of the key native grass, Deschampsia cespitosa. Hand-removal of woody species was also effective at reducing woody cover and promoted the abundance of some native species, but it sometimes increased the cover of non-native herbaceous species. Because mowing with removal of cut material was ineffective in reducing woody cover and tended to promote non-native herbaceous species, this treatment is not recommended as a management tool.

AB The oil sands industry located in northeastern Alberta, Canada, generates large volumes of effluent characterized by a high level of dissolved ions and naphthenic acids. The dikes used to store the effluent seep, creating wetlands which are subsequently invaded by obligate wetland flora such as cattail (Typha latifolia L.). The appearance of these wetlands prompted the oil sands industry to consider wetlands as part of their reclamation strategy. However, to ensure long-term viability of such wetlands, the response of the flora to the industrial effluent needed to be determined. To this end, apparent photosynthesis (APS), the level of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) large subunit, dehydrin-related polypeptides, and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) were evaluated in cattail and alsike clover plants (Trifolium hybridum L.) exposed to the oil sands effluent. APS measured in plants impacted by oil sands effluent was significantly higher than that of plants in the non-impacted off-site location. Among the on-site locations, plants growing in the natural wetlands site had higher APS compared to all other sites. The level of RuBisCo was not increased in cattail or clover growing in effluent-contaminated sites indicating that enhanced photosynthesis was not due to greater levels of this enzyme. Dehydrin-related polypeptides were detected only in the roots of cattail and were absent in clover. The polypeptide profile was altered in cattail exposed to oil sands effluent indicating that they were responding to an osmotic stress. The level of PDI was unaffected in the leaves of cattail regardless of the nature of the effluent to which they were exposed. Overall, the data indicate that cattail and clover are adapted to the oil sands effluent, although further studies are needed to assess their longterm ability to survive in the presence of this anthropogenic stress.

AB The localization of sulfate reducing sites in forested catchments is of major importance, because dissimilatory sulfate reduction can be a considerable sink for deposited sulfate. To localize dissimilatory sulfate reduction sites in a forested catchment (northeastern Bavaria, Germany), three sites within the catchment (upland site, intermittent seep, fen) were investigated for delta S-34 depth profiles of soil sulfur and potential sulfate reduction rates were measured with S-35 radiolabeling. Stable sulfur isotopes indicate that aerobic metabolism is the dominant process on the upland site and the intermittent seep (delta S-34 Of soil sulfur between + 1.6 and + 9.0 parts per thousand) and dissimilatory reduction is not a significant sink for sulfate. However, results of the S-35 radiolabeling indicated for the upland site that the soil has potentially high sulfate reduction rates under laboratory conditions. Soil sulfur of the fen was markedly depleted in S-34 (delta S-34 between -6 and +2.6 parts per thousand). Both, S-34 and S-35 data indicated that dissimilatory sulfate reduction is an ongoing process on this site. The S-34 and S-35 approaches are complementary. While measurements using S-35 can show momentary potential for dissimilatory bacterial sulfate reduction, delta S-34 data reflect long-term predominance of either assimilatory or dissimilatory S metabolism at a particular site.

AB The environmental influence on the mercury content in roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) is investigated using partial least square regression on 46 environmental variables describing the land use in the catchment area, various catchment area and lake characteristics, lake water chemistry, and fish stock. The Hg content in the fish from the 78 investigated circumneutral lakes is heavily influenced by the land use in their surroundings. The boreal forest lakes possessed the highest Hg levels in roach, whereas fish from lakes surrounded by arable land had lower levels. The Hg levels also showed a negative relationship to the amount of dissolved ions and the total amount of nutrients in lake water. Lake pH did not have any significant influence on the Hg content in roach in these non-acidified lakes. The Hg levels in lakes influenced by large amounts of wetland were less well explained by the presently investigated environmental variables, which implies that the Hg burden in fish from this kind of lake is governed by other factors.

AB Field studies were conducted in two different marsh habitats in Louisiana coastal wetlands to evaluate the effects of oiling (using South Louisiana Crude oil, SLC) and the effectiveness of a shoreline cleaner (COREXIT 9580) in removing oil from plant canopies. The study sites represented two major marsh habitats; the brackish marsh site was covered by Spartina patens and the freshwater marsh was covered by Sagittaria lancifolia. Field studies were conducted in each habitat using replicated 5.8 m(2) plots that were subjected to three treatments; oiled only, oiled + cleaner (cleaner was used 2 days after oiling), and a control. Plant gas exchange responses, survival, growth, and biomass accumulation were measured. Results indicated that oiling led to rapid reductions in leaf gas exchange rates in both species. However, both species in 'oiled + cleaned' plots displayed improved leaf conductance and CO? fixation rates. Twelve weeks after treatment initiation, photosynthetic carbon fixation in both species had recovered to normal levels. Over the short-term? S. patens showed more sensitivity to oiling with SLC than S. lancifolia as was evident from the data of the number of live shoots and above-ground biomass. Above-ground biomass remained significantly lower than control in S. patens under 'oiled' and 'oiled + cleaned' treatments while it was comparable to controls in S. lancifolia. These studies indicated that the cleaner removed oil from marsh grasses and alleviated the short-term impact of oil on gas exchange function of the study plants. However, use of cleaner had no detectable effects on above-ground biomass production or regeneration at the end of the first growing season in S. patens. Similarly, no beneficial effects of cleaner on carbon fixation and number of live shoots were apparent beyond 12 weeks in S. lancifolia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Review
DE arsenic; mercury; watershed; Moon Lake; Mississippi
AB To provide an understanding of arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) concentrations in soil, sediment, water, and fish tissues, samples were collected from a Mississippi River alluvial floodplain located in northwest Mississippi. As concentrations increased approximately an order of magnitude from water (5.12 mu g/l) to fish tissues (36.99 mu g/kg) and an additional two orders of magnitude in soils, lake sediments, and wetland sediments (5728. 5614, and 6746 mu g/kg), respectively. Average Hg concentrations in water, soils, lake sediments, and fish were 2.16 mu g/l, 55.1, 14.5 and 125 mu g/kg, respectively. As and Hg concentrations were within published ranges for uncontaminated soil, water, and sediments. As concentrations represented a lour risk. Hg concentrations were also low but showed a greater tendency to concentrate in fish tissue. The dominant mode of entry of these materials into aquatic systems is through storm-generated runoff Since both metals accompany sediments, agricultural conservation practices such as reduced tillage, buffer riparian strips, and bordering sediment ponds or drainage wetlands will minimize watershed input to aquatic systems.

AB Habitat use of breeding diving ducks is not well-documented. I studied nesting and brood-rearing female redheads (Aythya americana) in southwestern Manitoba during 1994 and 1995 to document habitat use and associations between wetland characteristics and reproductive success. Most females nested in small, semi-permanent wetlands and were successful in wetlands with large bands of emergent cover. Success was associated with water depth at the nest and distance between the nest and dry land. Brood-rearing females switched from smaller wetlands used for nesting to larger, semi-permanent wetlands. Successful females selected appropriate habitat whereas unsuccessful females showed no preferences. These results support a landscape approach to wetland management and emphasize the need for plans that reduce impact to wetland margins.

AB National Wetland Inventory (NWI) maps are widely used in the United States but have not been independently evaluated in the Great Lakes region nor in forested areas with level topography. Field data from 148 plots in the Hiawatha National Forest ecological classification and inventory program were combined with an additional review to evaluate NWI mapping accuracy. NWI maps were over 90% accurate in identifying uplands and jurisdictional wetlands. All nonforested wetlands were identified correctly. Uplands were correctly identified 96.9% of the time. The lowest level of accuracy, 90.7%, was achieved in identifying forested wetlands. The most common error was the NWI classification of wetlands on the AuGres soil series, a somewhat poorly drained upland soil that often occurs in complexes with wetland soils in the region. Forested wetlands with a cover type similar to adjacent uplands were also a source of error on NWI maps. The already high accuracy of NWI maps could be improved by the mapping of wetland-upland complexes, a development corresponding to the increased mapping of hydric-nonhydric soil complexes in area soil surveys. The continued refinement of regional lists of hydrophytic vegetation is supported by indicator status discrepancies between an extensive Hiawatha National Forest database and the current NWI list for the region.

AB Resource managers confronted with preserving ecosystems for prairie wetland birds in fragmented landscapes require landscape studies that direct conservation efforts over broad geographic regions. We investigated the role of local and landscape factors affecting habitat suitability by integrating remotely sensed wetland and land-cover data with wetland bird habitat models. We linked habitat models with locations of easement and-fee-title wetlands to evaluate spatial location and extent of protected, suitable habitat. We also simulated impacts of the loss of small wetlands on suitability of larger wetlands for mobile species that use multiple wetlands. Lastly, we evaluated the efficacy of waterfowl habitat programs in preserving suitable habitat for nongame wetland bird species to recommend strategies for maximizing regional landscape connectivity. Regional databases constructed for this study indicate that easement and fee-title tracts encompass 13.9% (1.2 million ha) of land area and protect 19.8% of the wetlands in eastern South Dakota, USA. Proportion of protected wetlands is highest for semi-permanent (32.3%), intermediate for seasonal (25.6%), and lowest for temporary wetlands (15.8%). A stratified, two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select 834 semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands that were surveyed for birds in 1995 and 1996. Logistic analyses indicate that habitat suitability for some species (e.g., Virginia rail, pied-billed grebe) is related to local vegetation conditions within wetlands, while suitability for others (e.g., northern pintail, black tern) is related to landscape structure at larger scales. As a result, unfragmented prairie wetland landscapes (i.e., areas with wetland complexes embedded within upland grasslands) provide habitat for more species than isolated wetlands in tillage fields. Models developed from survey wetlands were used to classify habitat suitability for all semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands in eastern South Dakota. Small wetlands are critical components of the surrounding landscape that influence habitat suitability of larger wetlands. Models used to reclassify suitability of larger remaining wetlands after small wetlands (<0.5 ha) were removed indicate that species most vulnerable to loss of small wetlands are vagile species that exploit resources over broad spatial scales. Number of wetlands suitable for northern pintails, a mobile species that uses multiple wetlands within a season, decreased 20.7% when wetlands <0.5 ha were removed. Historic paradigms dictating waterfowl habitat protection efforts also have conserved habitat for nongame bird species. Modern paradigms that acknowledge the importance of small shallow wetlands to breeding waterfowl have shifted the focus of protection towards preserving habitat for species that occupy more abundant seasonal wetlands. Cessation of protection efforts would result in further fragmentation of regional wetland landscapes. We recommend that wetlands be acquired not only to consolidate suitable habitat within protected core areas but also to ensure that core areas coalesce to preserve connectivity among regional wetland landscapes.

AB The Kyoto Protocol accepts terrestrial sinks for greenhouse gases (GHGs) as offsets for fossil fuel emissions. Only carbon sequestered in Living biomass from re- and afforestation is presently considered, but the Protocol contains a provision for the possible future inclusion of other land uses and soils. As a result, the possibility of sequestration of carbon in wetlands, and particularly peatlands, is being discussed. Natural peatlands are presently a relatively small sink for CO2 and a large source of CH4: globally, they store between 400 and 500 Gt C. There are large variations among peatlands, but when the "global warming potential" of CH4 is factored in, many peatlands are neither sinks nor sources of GHGs. Some land-use changes may result in peatlands acting as net sinks far GHGs by reducing CH4 emissions and/or increasing CO2 sequestration (e.g., forest drainage), while other land uses may result in large losses of CO2, CH4, and N2O (e.g., agriculture on organic soils, flooding for hydroelectric generation). Other land uses, such as peatland creation and restoration, produce no net change if they are replacing or restoring a previous level of GHG exchange. These are analogous to reforestation of deforested areas. On closer examination, the inclusion of peatlands in a national greenhouse gas strategy as sinks, despite their large role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, may not significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissons. If the sinks are to be considered, it is reasonable that terrestrial sources associated with all land uses on peatlands also should be considered. If peatlands are not considered explicitly, but soils in forest and agriculture systems are included in the Kyoto Protocol in the future, then those peatlands impacted by these land uses will be incorporated implicitly.

AB Zooplankton structure and dynamics were studied in a freshwater wetland subject to strong hydrologic fluctuations. This wetland underwent a six-year drought that terminated at the end of 1996. At that time, inundation area and water level increased, diminishing macrophyte cover in some cases and enhancing a continuing eutrophication problem. Sampling was performed monthly from January 1996 to December 1998 in five shallow water sites. Zooplankton were a mixture of limnetic and littoral species (66 rotifer, 15 cladoceran, and 10 copepod taxa, plus unidentified oligotrichid and peritrichid ciliates), the composition of which changed coincident with the shift of the hydrologic conditions. The most common taxa were bdelloid rotifers and Lecane closterocerca. The microcrustaceans Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia curvirostris, and Acanthocyclops robustus were frequent. Ciliates were the most important component of zooplankton in terms of biomass, except in spring when cladocerans were dominant. Rotifer biomass was the lowest fraction of zooplankton. When community structure was described by taxonomic classes, mean biomass, or time biomass trajectories, only weak spatial patterns were found following the flux of water in the wetland. Each zoo-plankton group was distinctly affected by flood. Ciliates and rotifers increased biomass after the flooding, possibly as a result of the enhancement of eutrophication; cladoceran populations decreased after the flooding likely due to macrophyte loss that facilitated planktivorous fish control. Copepods increased biomass consequent to the stabilized water level. There was a clear seasonal trend of zooplankton biomass seemingly unaffected by flood. Ciliates and rotifers had fluctuating low biomass in winter-spring, with maximum biomass in summer-autumn; cladocerans appeared and peaked only in spring; copepods peaked in late winter and spring.

TI Hydrology and land use in a Sahelian floodplain wetland
SO WETLANDS
LA English

DE hydrology; land use; floodplain; wetland; Nigeria
ID SCALE IRRIGATION; NIGERIA; WATER
AB Africa's numerous floodplain wetlands provide a host of hydrologic, ecological, economic, and social benefits. They play a fundamental role in supporting significant human populations. In common with all wetlands, the hydrology of Africa's floodplains is central to their functioning and in turn plays a key role in determining the benefits that they provide. The timing and extent of wet-season inundation are major influences upon the temporal and spatial distribution of floodplain resource use. Using results from intensive hydrologic surveys, supplemented by analyses of river flow data and flood extent maps, this paper delineates areas within the Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands of northeastern Nigeria according to their hydrologic characteristics. This delineation is used in combination with a land-use map derived from aerial and field surveys to examine the impacts of hydrology upon human activities and land use. The timing of different cultivation practices in the wetlands is shown to be in tune with the annual flood cycle. Rice is cultivated in inundated areas that are then planted with other crops after the floods recede. The intensity of fishing and cattle grazing also varies with the pattern of rising and falling water levels. The distribution of major land uses is strongly influenced by spatial variations in hydrologic characteristics. The location of rice cultivation and small-scale irrigation is determined by water availability in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Extensive flood rice farms are found along the Jama'are River, which contributes over 70% of the river inflow to the wetlands. Within the Hadejia River system, important hood rice areas are the Madachi Swamp and the Marma Channel. The primary area of small-scale irrigation is along the Burum Gana River in which small, but year-round, flows are maintained by return hows from upstream irrigation schemes. This area, which covers only 13% of the land-use map, contains 48% of the area of small-scale irrigation. Extensive inundation seems to act as a barrier to human activities in some areas and is responsible for the maintenance of natural vegetation within central parts of the wetlands. Modifications to the hydrologic characteristics of some parts of the wetlands resulting from drought and upstream irrigation schemes have required local communities to adapt, with varying degrees of success, their modes of floodplain resource use. Farmers along the Burum Gana have embraced small-scale irrigation, while those along the Keffin Hausa River, which has all but dried up, have had no option but to concentrate on rain-fed agriculture. The strong inter-connections between hydrology, land use, and human activities dictate that any further hydrologic modifications should not be undertaken without a full appreciation of their potential impacts.

TI Effects of roadside transect width on waterfowl and wetland estimates

ID NORTH-AMERICA; NUMBER
AB Strip transects located along roads are commonly used to estimate waterfowl populations and characterize associated wetland habitat. We used data collected in May and early June, 1995, on forty-five 40-km(2) plots in North Dakota to evaluate bias of 800-m and 400-m wide roadside transects for sampling wetlands relative to a larger (40-km(2)) scale and to compare duck abundance at the two widths. Densities of all basins combined and of seasonal basins considered alone were biased high for both transect widths, but mean bias did not differ from zero for temporary or semipermanent basins. Biases did not occur when excavated seasonal and temporary basins (i.e., road ditches) were excluded from the sample. Mean basin density was higher for the inner (400-m) transect width than for the outer transect width (area remaining of the 800-m transect, outside of center 400-m width) for all basins combined and for seasonal and temporary basins. We detected an area-related bias in the occurrence of basins in transects: smaller basins (0.08-1.6 ha) were over-represented in transect samples by 2.9-6.5%, and larger basins (greater than or equal to 11 ha) were under-represented in 800-m transects by 7.3% and in 400-m transects by 16.3%. We compared the distribution of ducks relative to water conditions in the inner and outer transect widths to evaluate whether they were affected by proximity to the road. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.), northern pintails (A. acuta L.), and gadwall (A. strepera L.) responded to water conditions equally in the inner and outer transect widths, but northern shovelers (A. clypeata L.) and blue-winged teal (A, discors L.) responded more strongly to wetlands on the inner than the outer transect width, indicating that estimates of these species would be higher from a 400-m wide transect than from an 800-m wide transect. Differences in an adjustment index, used to account for the portion of basin obscured from view, were highly variable between inner and outer transect widths but did not indicate that use of wider transects was hampered by visibility. Biases of transect sampling need to be carefully considered when extrapolating wetland basin or duck densities from transects to larger landscape scales.

AB Wetlands are created to compensate for the loss of natural wetlands as a result of human landuse activities. How well these constructed wetlands mimic natural wetlands is in debate. The goal of this study was to compare soil and other environmental conditions within constructed and adjacent reference wetlands to assess the progress of the constructed wetlands towards a functional wetland. Three constructed wetlands in Virginia, USA, 4 to 7 years old, were paired with adjacent palustrine forested and scrub-shrub reference wetlands to examine differences in topography, hydrology, soil properties, and other environment conditions such as soil temperature and redox potential. Degree of microrelief was greater in reference wetlands than in the associated constructed wetlands. Seasonal fluctuations in water-table levels were similar in both wetland types. Two of the paired wetlands showed considerable differences (15 to 20 cm) in the depth to the water table. Redox potentials were similar in reference and constructed wetlands. Paired wetlands with water-table levels at or near the soil surface throughout the year showed similar soil temperatures. At the site where the summer water levels were 80 to 100 cm below the soil surface, summer temperatures were substantially higher in the poorly shaded, constructed wetland. At the two sites with high water-table levels throughout the year, percent clay and silt, levels of organic C and N, and cation exchange capacity were significantly greater (p <0.05) in the reference wetlands. At the drier site, only 3 of the 16 soil parameters compared were significantly different. In this limited study, observed differences in soil and other environmental conditions between paired wetlands suggest that constructed wetlands may not function in the same capacity as adjacent reference wetlands.

AB Denitrification measurements were made under simulated field conditions using sediment cores and water collected from the Hemet/San Jacinto Multipurpose Demonstration Wetland (Riverside County, California, USA). The 9.9 ha constructed wetland is used to both polish ammonia-dominated secondary municipal effluent and provide migratory bird habitat. The wetland was originally constructed as a marsh-pond-marsh system in 1994. Over the period from January through March 1998, measured denitrification rates averaged 20.9 +/- 20.9 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh portions of the wetland and 646 +/- 353 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate for this period was 0.70 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for about 8% of the total N removed by the wetland. Internal retention was the main N-removal mechanism. Synoptic water quality surveys indicated that denitrification was limited by a lack of nitrification within the wetland. Between April 1998 and January 1999, the wetland was reconfigured as a hemi-marsh system, having equal areas of interspersed emergent marsh and deep open water. In May 1999, measured denitrification rates averaged 1414 +/- 298 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh zones and 682 +/- 218 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in the open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate was 3.58 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for 40% of the total N removed by the wetland. A synoptic water quality survey indicated that nitrification within the wetland had been enhanced by the reduction of emergent macrophyte biomass and the increase in the area of interspersed deep open water. The modifications to the wetland shifted the nitrogen balance from a large internal storage component and a small denitrification component in 1998 to a more denitrifying system in 1999.

AB In the early 1900s, baldcypress swamps were harvested en masse in coastal Louisiana, USA. In many areas, natural regeneration did not occur; instead, these areas converted to marsh or open water. One of the factors that may have been responsible for the lack of regeneration was shading of newly-germinated seedlings by herbaceous vegetation. Alternatively, prolonged flooding or complete submergence may have suppressed germination or growth rates of young seedlings and even caused mortality. This study investigated the effects of complete submergence and variable light regime on two age classes of baldcypress seedlings. Newly-germinated seedlings (under two weeks of age) subjected to complete submergence began to show clear signs of stress after approximately one month and substantial mortality following 45 days of submergence. In contrast, one-year-old seedlings submerged for as much as five months experienced up to 75% survival. In a four-way factorial experiment, two age classes of baldcypress seedlings were subjected to five light transmissions (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%, 20%), five flood durations (0 days, 14 days, 25 days, 35 days, 45 days), and two nutrient regimes (fertilized vs. not fertilized). At 100% light transmission, the newly germinated seedlings suffered complete mortality after 35 days of submergence, whereas the one-year-old seedlings were largely unaffected by prolonged flooding or light regime. Fertilized one-year-old seedlings that were submerged for an entire month had considerably greater growth in height and diameter than seedlings grown under mesic conditions without fertilizer. This is particularly important in coastal Louisiana because several re-introductions (i.e., diversions) of Mississippi River water into declining swamps are planned or underway, and these diversions will periodically increase nutrient and flood levels.

AB Seasonal forest ponds (SFPs) are isolated, ephemeral lentic habitats in upland forest ecosystems. These ponds occur commonly throughout temperate forests. Faunal communities of these ponds are dominated by invertebrates. Composition of these communities varies temporally both between years and also seasonally within a single hydrologic year, composition is most affected by pond permanence or hydroperiod. Benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs) were sampled up to three times a year in five SFPs between 1994 and 1996. The ponds were of short, intermediate, and long hydroperiod. Hydroperiod also varied among years, based on precipitation patterns. During the study, 64,000 specimens of 57 taxa were collected. No pattern was identified in the variation of BMI abundance among years and pond hydroperiod; abundance increased with successive surveys within years. Taxon richness and diversity varied significantly with pond hydroperiod, increasing with increasing hydroperiod. Diversity measures increased over the three years of the study but without obvious pattern across the successive surveys within years. Insects dominated the samples, but large numbers of other Arthropoda and Oligochaeta were also collected. Chironomidae were dominant in most ponds, years, and surveys; chironomid dominance was significantly greater in shorter hydroperiod ponds. Seasonal forest ponds function as aquatic islands in a "sea" of terrestrial forest. The effect of hydroperiod on the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate community is analogous to that of size on marine island fauna, longer hydroperiod ponds generally have richer invertebrate communities just as larger marine islands typically have richer faunas. However, the effect is confounded by the close relationship between pond hydroperiod and pond size/volume.

AB We related macroinvertebrate community structure to physical, chemical, and biological gradients in flow-through constructed wetlands receiving secondarily treated domestic wastewater and lower-nutrient river water in Ohio, USA. Macroinvertebrates collected with benthic colonization plates and emergence traps were analyzed with diversity, biotic, and combination indices and related to seventeen parameters of water quality, substrate characteristics, and primary productivity in both wetland systems. A total of 36 and 39 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected in the wastewater wetland and river wetland, respectively. Invertebrate communities nearest to the wastewater source in the wastewater wetland had significantly lower (mean +/- SE) Simpson diversity (0.5 +/- 0.13) and Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) scores (2.6 +/- 0.8) than those of other sampling locations. Sampling locations near the middle and outflow of the wastewater wetland had diversity scores (0.84 +/- 0.01) and ICI scores (4.8 +/- 0.7) statistically similar to sites in the river-fed wetlands. Average diel dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity were the best environmental predictors of invertebrate community metrics; these variables along with chemical oxygen demand and nitrate-nitrogen described nearly 90% of the ICI variation in a four-predictor regression model. Multiple correspondence analysis showed sampling locations loosely grouped by average diel dissolved oxygen, which described 65.4% of the overall variation in the gradient data, and specific conductivity, which described and additional 16.4%. Macroinvertebrate analyses are presented as a valuable means of assessing the ecological status of wetlands used to improve water quality and as an important supplement for traditional chemical analyses.

ID STEM NODULES; ROOT-NODULES
AB Twenty-eight legume species (14% Caesalpinieae, 29% Mimosoidene, and 57% Papilionoideae) were found growing actively in the wetlands and riversides of Guadeloupe. Only 11% of the checked species appeared not to be nodulated after repeated investigation in the field, and all belong to the Caesalpinieae tribe. The legume distribution brings out the importance of this family in the wetlands in terms of abundance of legume trees and shrubs. In wet meadows, herb and liana legumes have low cover and species richness, allowing the Poaceae to dominate. Of the 19 species of trees and shrubs, 17 have shown efficient N-fixing symbiosis in natural conditions. N-fixing legume predominance seems to be a biotic characteristic that recurs in perennial plant communities of flooded habitats. Efficient N-fixing symbiosis under flood conditions is achieved through various nodulation strategies including (i) waterlogging tolerance with aquatic nodules associated with aerenchymateous tissue, (ii) seasonal avoidance brought about by short-lived determinate nodules, and (iii) spatial stress avoidance with aerial nodules developing on root, plank buttress or stem.

AB Developing an understanding of wetland hydrology that is free from site-specific constraints is difficult. Many hydrologic studies are focused upon a single site and the development of water-budget components. Our previous research (Cole et al. 1997) examined the hydrology of several wetlands based upon monthly sampling during the growing season. Those data did not provide adequate information on moisture regimes and did not tell us enough about year-round hydrodynamics. Our new objective was to expand hydrologic analyses to a larger proportion of our reference wetlands and extend them over a longer period of time. We continued to organize our wetlands and our analyses around hydrogeomorphic (HGM) principles. We found ground-water-dominated wetlands (riparian depressions and slopes) to be the wettest sites. Surface-water systems (headwater and mainstem floodplain wetlands) were drier. We found little difference between slopes and the floodplain wetlands in the amount of time water was within the root zone. Riparian depressions were wetter longer, as the average duration of water within the root zone was almost a year for riparian depressions and much less for all other wetland types. Disturbance seemed to play a large role in hydrologic behavior, even more than did HGM classification. We believe that knowledge of HGM subclass might serve as a useful surrogate for actual knowledge of site-specific hydrology. The level of uncertainty increases with surface-water systems, but we have shown a large degree of predictability by HGM subclass. Our data likely have applicability within the entire Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains in the United States, although our conclusions have not been tested over that wide latitudinal range.

ID LANDSCAPE
AB The poorly drained pine flatwoods of the Lower Coastal Plain of the Southern United States, including Florida, contain many pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) wetlands, which cover about one-third of the area. Management of the resource includes pine silviculture and cypress harvesting for lumber, plywood, paper, and mulch. Concern about the ecological impacts and hydrologic effects prompted a cooperative study of cypress wetlands integrating several disciplines. This paper reports results of clear-cut harvesting on the wetland hydrology. Three wetlands of about 0.5 ha were selected and instrumented to measure the climatic and hydrologic variables before and after treatments from January 1993 to January 1997. Silvicultural treatments were wetland-only clear-cut harvesting, wetland plus surrounding upland clear-cut harvesting, and an undisturbed control. The absence of observable soil surface runoff thigh infiltration rate) and slow ground-water movement in the upland pine flatwoods suggested that normally the precipitation and evapotranspiration balanced each other and that the wetlands generated most of the runoff from the landscape mosaic as a whole. However, the results showed that open-water evaporation after wetland harvesting exceeded evapotranspiration of the control, explaining in part a decrease in outflow after wetland-only harvesting. increased runoff from the pine upland, generated by reduced evapotranspiration and expanded saturated areas after clear-cut harvesting, apparently was buffered to some extent by increased evaporation from the embedded clear-cut cypress wetland. The average open-water area was about fifty percent larger than the wetland area as defined by the vegetation. However, excess wetland water balance data suggested the presence of a rain-catchment area that was 2-3 times larger than the vegetative wetland area because of semi-saturated soil in the low slopes. Therefore, the actual catchment area of a cypress wetland in the pine flatwoods may be variable in time, space, and silviculture depending on the topography, the extent of open water, and saturated soil. The application of this information in water management is for better control of first-year runoff from the pine-cypress landscape as a whole. Furthermore, silvicultural Best Management Practices for cypress wetland water management need to consider a variable source area for surface-water pollution that is larger than the wetland area as defined by the vegetation.

AB The Missouri River floodplain historically contained numerous wetlands; however, alterations to the corridor have resulted in the loss of flood-pulse processes. The annual contributions of small wetlands (<15 ha) perched on the Missouri River floodplain have not been viewed as important; however, consequences of draining or filling perched wetlands in the upper Missouri River basin remain unclear. The objective of this study was to survey aquatic fauna and basic habitat characteristics in a small perched wetland before, during, and after a connection period within a naturally functioning section of the Missouri River. Fishes, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, and habitat parameters were sampled during May, July, and September 1997. No significant differences (P > 0.05; F < 4.2; df = 2,9) in densities or catch-per-unit-effort among sample periods were detected for macroinvertebrates. Copepoda nauplii, calanoid Copepoda, and Bosmina spp. densities showed significant changes (P < 0.03; F > 6.1; df = 2,9) and collectively surpassed 3,200 organisms/L. These densities exceeded other regional means by as much as 900%. Twenty-four fish species were documented in the wetland; however, the black bullhead, Ameiurus melas Rafinesque, dominated the fish community. Wetland depth and surface area increased during the connection period and inundated terrestrial grasses and woody debris. Decay of submerged organic matter, combined with the lack of rooted macrophytes, loss of algal productivity to flushing, and higher turbidity, may have all contributed to reduced summer dissolved oxygen levels. Avian feeding activity suggested that fishes were using the upper water column when nearly anoxic lower water column conditions existed. Although the wetland habitat may be harsh, presence of juvenile fishes and dense zooplankton populations establishes the potential importance of these water bodies to the Missouri River ecosystem.

AB The purpose of this research was to determine if slope and exposure are important determinants of plant communities emerging on reservoir shorelines. We sampled 30 sites on the previously inundated shoreline of Cave Run Lake, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood-control reservoir in east-central Kentucky, USA. These sites were categorized as either flats, riparian forests, exposed banks, or sheltered banks. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and detrended correspondence analysis were used with presence/absence data to group sites of similar community composition. There were 167 species of plants identified in the study plots, of which 29% were annuals, 2% were biennials, 69% were perennials, 11% were non-indigenous, and 63% met the criterion for inclusion in community analysis. A distinct assemblage of plant species was associated with all riparian forests, with six of eight flats, and with five of twelve exposed banks. Six sheltered banks were not obviously associated with a single community type. The TWINSPAN group including riparian forests had the highest percentage of wetland species; the TWINSPAN group including most flats had the highest species richness; the TWINSPAN group comprised entirely of exposed banks had low species richness and low representation of wet:land species. Our results suggest that plant communities of high conservation value can emerge on relatively flat sites under a human-controlled flooding regimen as long as the soil remains intact. However, steep exposed banks are susceptible to soil loss, and the resulting rock substrates support a depauperate flora of low conservation value.

AB The Okefenokee Swamp is at 160,000 ha freshwater wetland in Southeast Georgia, USA that developed in a landscape basin. Hydrologic variability across the swamp suggests that water-surface elevations are not uniform across the swamp. The topographic surface map discussed herein was developed to describe the swamp topography at local to landscape scales and relate the swamp peat- and sand-surface elevations to elevation above mean sea level. These data were then used to relate water-surface elevations across the swamp so that the swamp hydrologic environment could be described spatially and temporally with a spatial hydrology model. The swamp was divided into 5 sub-basins that reflect similar seasonal hydrodynamics but also indicate local conditions unique to the basins. Topographic gradient influences water-level dynamics in the western swamp (2 sub-basins), which is dominated by the Suwannee River floodplain. The eastern swamp (3 sub-basins) is terraced, and the regional hydrology is driven less by topographic gradient and more by precipitation and evapotranspiration volumes. The relatively steep gradient and berm and lake features in the western swamp's Suwannee River floodplain limit the spatial extent of the Suwannee River sill's effects, whereas system sensitivities to evapotranspiration rates are more important drivers of hydrology in the eastern swamp.

AB Developing a more thorough understanding of water and chemical budgets in wetlands depends in part on our ability to quantify time-varying interactions between ground water and surface water. We used a combined water and solute mass balance approach to estimate time-varying ground-water discharge and recharge in the Everglades Nutrient Removal project (ENR), a relatively large constructed wetland (1544 hectare) built for removing nutrients from agricultural drainage in the northern Everglades in South Florida, USA. Over a 4-year period (1994 through 1998), ground-water recharge averaged 13.4 hectare-meter per day (ha-m/day) or 0.9 cm/day, which is approximately 31% of surface water pumped into the ENR for treatment. In contrast, ground-water discharge was much smaller (1.4 ha-m/day, or 0.09 cm/day, or 2.8% of water input to ENR for treatment). Using a water-balance approach alone only allowed net ground-water exchange (discharge - recharge) to be estimated (-12 +/- 2.4 ha-m/day). Discharge and recharge were individually determined by combining a chloride mass balance with the water balance. For a variety of reasons, the ground-water discharge estimated by the combined mass balance approach was not reliable (1.4 +/- 37 ha-m/day). As a result, ground-water interactions could only be reliably estimated by comparing the mass-balance results with other independent approaches, including direct seepage-meter measurements and previous estimates using ground-water modeling. All three independent approaches provided similar estimates of average ground-water recharge, ranging from 13 to 14 ha-m/day. There was also relatively good agreement between ground-water discharge estimates for the mass balance and seepage meter methods, 1.4 and 0.9 ha-m/day, respectively. However, ground-water-flow modeling provided an average discharge estimate that was approximately a factor of four higher (5.4 ha-m/day) than the other two methods. Our study developed an initial understanding of how the design and operation of the ENR increases interactions between ground water and surface water. A considerable portion of recharged ground water (73%) was collected and returned to the ENR by a seepage canal. Additional recharge that was not captured by the seepage canal only occurred when pumped inflow rates to ENR land ENR water levels) were relatively high. Management of surface water in the northern Everglades therefore clearly has the potential to increase interactions with ground water.

AB Field mapping and monitoring of vegetation, sedimentation patterns, substrate characteristics, and geomorphology in the Bush River tributary to upper Chesapeake Bay has been conducted since 1991 to ascertain the process-morphology dynamics in a tidal freshwater marsh. Nine plant associations from 5 distinct marsh habitats were identified by clustering species abundance measurements from 115 quadrats throughout an 84-hectare area. High spatial variability in physical habitat conditions such as summer-average sediment deposition, summer-average organic content, and surface-sediment grain size distributions were explainable using combinations of independent variables, including elevation, plant distributions, and distances to the tidal inlet and an adjacent stream. Sedimentation and vegetation were both observed to show a predictable response to disturbance by animal activity.

TI The wetland grass Glyceria fluitans for revegetation of metal mine

SO WETLANDS
LA English

DE mine tailings; revegetation; wetland cover; Glyceria fluitans
ID ZINC; TRACE
AB Revegetation under wetland rather than dryland conditions provides an alternative to traditional methods of rehabilitation of metal mine tailings. The wetland plant Glyceria fluitans (floating sweetgrass) was found growing in a lead/zinc mine-tailings pond. The potential of this species for revegetation of mine tailings under wetland conditions had not previously been investigated. In two outdoor experiments, G. fluitans of non-contaminated origin grew successfully on alkaline tailings containing elevated metal concentrations (230 mu mol g(-1) Zn, 11 mu mol g(-1) Pb). Growth of G. fluitans was significantly enhanced on tailings treated with NPK fertilizer (700 kg ha(-1)), but the plants grew well even without fertilizer, indicating a low nutrient requirement. Glyceria fluitans did not survive on saline (MgSO4) tailings originating from another mine that contained much higher lead (34 mu mol g(-1)) and iron (2584 mu mol g(-1)) concentrations. The ability of G. fluitans to tolerate many of the adverse conditions associated with mine tailings favors its use for revegetation purposes.

AB Mountain fens are uncommon and unique wetlands in the southern Appalachian Highlands. We selected four mountain fens in North Carolina to compare soil particle-size distribution, organic carbon, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable Mg+2, Ca+2, and K+. Three of the sites are depressional areas on alluvial floodplains at elevations between 700 and 1130 m above sea level, while the fourth site is located on a slope intersecting ground-water seepage at an elevation of 950 m. Feat accumulation amounted to a shallow surface Sphagnum layer (usually <5 cm) at three sites, and the organic carbon content of the surface soil horizon ranged from 4 to 21%. Three of the soils would be classified as Cumulic Humaquepts, and the other is a Terric Haplohemist. The pH of the surface horizon of the four soils ranged from 4.3 to 4.9. The alluvial fens had higher silt concentrations than the seepage fen, and two of the alluvial fens had a subsurface, fine-textured deposit. The seepage fen showed little textural variation with depth. Exchangeable Ca+2 concentrations were higher for the seepage fen. The CEC ranged from 15 to 62 cmol, kg(-1) in the surface horizon, and base saturation (Ca+2, Mg+2, and K+) was <12% for the three alluvial fens and 20% for the seepage fen. Base saturation increased to 40% in the lower horizons of the seepage fen but remained <10% for the alluvial fens. The differences in soil characteristics suggest that geomorphic location should be considered when comparing mountain fens.

AB Sediment transport and deposition along a stream in an agricultural basin (65 km(2)) in northern Missouri, USA were quantified as part of a long-term study to evaluate effects of silvicultural practices on the hydrology, sediment, vegetation, and wildlife characteristics of remaining forested riparian systems. Median cumulative sediment deposition, measured using feldspar clay pads, increased from August 1995 to August 1998 at a rate of about 1 cm/yr. Median deposition amounts from single floods ranged from 0.03 cm to 0.64 cm. Floodplain and riparian maintenance flows corresponded to monitored floods with calculated recurrence intervals as low as <2 years. Simple linear regression models, using flood event suspended-sediment load or streamflow characteristics, explained up to 82 percent of variability in median event sediment deposition on the floodplain clay pads. There was little apparent correlation between cumulative shortterm deposition and site elevation, distance from channel, longitudinal distance, or fluvial landform type. This may be due to upstream channelization, floodplain complexity, short duration of events, or sediment-load characteristics of low-recurrence interval floods (<2 to 5 years) sampled in this study. Dendrogeomorphic measurements indicated a substantial increase in the mean rate of deposition on the Long Branch Creek floodplain from about 1950 through 1980. Eighty-nine percent of the clay pad monitoring sites and all dendrogeomorphic monitoring sites experienced net positive deposition emphasizing the role of this riparian area as a net sediment storage site.

AB Previous research shows an anomalous absence of plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides) woodlands along a 30 lan sandy braid-channel reach of the Milk River upstream of the Fresno Dam in northern Montana, USA. This absence contrasts to well-wooded, meandering reaches upriver and downriver of the braid-plain. Our held measurements show that mechanical ice breakups and ice flees physically damage most plains cottonwood saplings and small trees along the braid-plain. Between 1911 and 1998, mechanical ice breakups occurred in 50% of the years of record. Of these, 12% were greater than bankfull discharge and followed dramatic temperature increases and subsequent snowpack melting in the headwaters. We suggest that the absence of cottonwood woodlands on the braid-plain is associated with low bank heights, wide channels, and low channel sinuosity in the braiding reach through which overbank river ice moves more easily compared to the meandering reaches. Ice blocks rafted onto the braid-plain have repeatedly scarred, bent, broken (trunks partially detached, roots not displaced), sheared (trunk detached, roots partially displaced), and toppled (trunks and roots displaced) cottonwoods, causing an absence of middle- to old-aged trees. Even though hundreds of new stem and stump shoots have sprouted since the last major ice damage (1996), very few trees are present on the braid-plain compared to the meandering reaches. Almost all (94-100%) cottonwoods on the braid-plain were damaged by ice in 1996 (but only 23% in the meandering reaches). All damaged cottonwoods were scarred; up to 42% of the ice-damaged trees on the braid-plain died from shearing and toppling. Wetlands in the U.S. and Canada are defined on the basis of frequency of flooding and presence of water-logged soils that support hydrophytic plants. Ice plays a critical role in limiting plant distribution in northern riparian wetlands and should be incorporated into revisions of existing classification systems.

AB Seven wetlands from two dune systems on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia were studied for sediment properties associated with phosphorus retention and potential remobilization. Sediments from the Spearwood Dunes had higher contents of silt, clay, and organic material. Sediment total phosphorus was positively correlated with water content, organic matter and silt content but inversely related to the amount of coarse materials. Part of the organic matter was refractory humic substances, and the molecular weight of humic acids ranged from less than 10,000 to over 600,000. Significant portions of sediment total P (5-73%) were bound to humic substances. The fraction of "loosely-bound phosphorus" (NH,CI-P) accounted for less than 10% of total-P. NaOH-extractable P was high; some humic substances were extracted with NaOH. Correlations between phosphorus forms and other components suggest an affinity between 'fine particles' of similar hydrologic density during sediment transport and reworking, and this involves most humic-P in these wetlands.

AB Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), an invasive perennial introduced from Southeast Asia, is currently spreading throughout the southeastern United States from Florida to Louisiana. In the U.S., cogongrass is generally not considered a wetland species, although it's range is expanding in regions with high wetland abundance. The objective of this study was to determine if excessive soil moisture might prevent cogongrass from establishing in areas with seasonally flooded soils. In one greenhouse experiment, we examined cogongrass germination and seedling growth in soils that were freely drained, saturated, and inundated. We performed a second greenhouse experiment to evaluate growth and survival of cogongrass seedlings of four different size classes in five soil moisture treatments ranging from dry to inundated. Cogongrass germination was lowest when seeds were overtopped with water. There were no differences in germination between saturated and freely drained treatments; however, seedlings grew largest in freely drained soil and were smallest when immersed. In our second experiment, most cogongrass plants survived except when given no water, but growth differed by watering treatment depending on seedling size. Increasing moisture was more detrimental to the growth of small seedlings compared to the growth of larger cogongrass plants. Overall, cogongrass was most sensitive to soil inundation in the earliest stages of establishment; thus, excessive moisture conditions in the spring, during early seedling development, could restrict invasion of cogongrass by seed. Once cogongrass is established, however, its tolerance of flooding appears to increase.

AB We excluded predatory fish from a marsh weedbed to evaluate experimentally their impact on invertebrate prey. Gut analyses of wetland fish, including pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), revealed that large numbers of midge larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) were consumed. However, our exclusion of these predatory fish from study habitats did not result in midge population increases. On the contrary, fewer epiphytic midges occurred where predatory fish had been excluded (P = 0.0043). populations of midge competitors (especially Planorbidae and Physidae) and invertebrate midge predators (especially Corixidae and Glossiphoniidae) were suppressed directly by fish, and midges that co-existed with fish apparently benefitted indirectly from those interactions. For epiphytic midge larvae, the negative direct influence of fish predation was strong, but positive indirect effects apparently were even more powerful.

AB We examined larval anuran assemblages at 12 temporary wetlands occurring on the MacArthur Agro-Ecology Research center (MAERC) in southcentral Florida. MAERC is an active cattle ranch, and the wetlands on the site are heavily influenced by an extensive series of ditches that drain the landscape. Ditching has resulted in a change from a historically extensive marsh system to a series of isolated wetlands surrounded by upland habitats. Because a majority of anurans in Florida breed exclusively or facultatively in wetlands whose drying regime excludes fish, we were interested in determining the value of these modified wetlands as breeding sites. We examined the effect of wetland size and hydrology on anuran use, and compared breeding activity across three summers that varied greatly in rainfall pattern. We sampled tadpoles from May 93 to August 93 and from May 94 to September 95. A total of 3678 tadpoles from 11 species was collected. Rana utricularia was the most abundant species and the only species found in every wetland. Species richness was related positively to wetland size (r = 0.65, p = 0.023) but not hydroperiod (r = 0.03, p = 0.93). Tadpole abundance was not related to wetland size (r = 0.35, p = 0.29) nor hydroperiod (r = 0.40, p = 0.22). Annual variation in rainfall resulted in significant changes in species composition. A drought during 1993 resulted in no breeding. A high water table in the spring of 1995 resulted in localized flooding in early summer on part of the ranch. Wetlands in these areas were exposed to spillover of water from ditches containing fishes. Wetlands so impacted showed significant changes in species composition from the previous year (x(2) = 1008, p < 0.0001), whereas wetlands that were not impacted did not differ in composition. The wetlands at MAERC provide dynamic habitats that offer varying breeding opportunities that are highly dependent on meteorological conditions.

AB Soil accretion, sediment deposition, and nutrient (N, P, organic C) accumulation were compared in floodplain and depressional freshwater wetlands of southwestern Georgia, USA to evaluate the role of riverine (2600 km(2) catchment) versus depressional (<10 km(2) catchment) wetlands as sinks for sediment and nutrients. Soil cores were collected from three floodplain (cypress-gum) and nine depressional (three each from cypress-gum forest, cypress-savannah, and herbaceous marsh) wetlands and analyzed for radionuclides ((CS)-C-137, Pb-210), bulk density, N, P, and organic C to quantify recent (30-year) and long-term (100-year) rates of sediment and nutrient accumulation. There was no significant difference in organic C, N, or sediment accumulation between depressional and floodplain wetlands. However, P accumulation was 1.5 to three times higher in the floodplain (0.12-0.75 g/m(2)/yr) than in the depressional wetlands (0.08-0.25 g/m(2)/yr). Sediment and nutrient accumulations were highly variable among depressional wetland types, more so than between depressional and floodplain wetlands. This variability likely is the result of differences in historical land use, hydrology, vegetation type, NPP, and perhaps fire frequency. Mean (n = 12) one-hundred-year rates of sediment deposition (1036 g/m(2)/yr), organic C (79 g/m(2)/yr), N (6.0 g/m(2)/yr), and P accumulation (0.38 g/m(2)/yr) were much higher than 30-year rates (sediment = 118 g/m(2)/yr, C = 20 g/m(2)/yr, N = 1.5 g/m(2)/yr, P = 0.09 g/m(2)/yr). Higher 100-year (Pb-210) Sediment and nutrient accumulations Likely reflect the greater numbers of farms, greater grazing by livestock, and the absence of environmentally sound agricultural practices in southwestern Georgia at the turn of the century. Our findings suggest that the degree of anthropogenic disturbance within the surrounding watershed regulates wetland sediment, organic C, and N accumulation. Phosphorus accumulation also is greater in floodplain wetlands that have large catchments containing fine textured (clay) sediments that are co-deposited with P.

AB Isotopic analyses of oxygen and hydrogen of water (delta(18)O and delta D) and nitrogen and oxygen of nitrate (delta(15)N and delta(18)O) are used in conjunction with conventional water chemistry and hydrologic measurements to investigate water flow and nitrogen cycling mechanisms through two riparian zones adjacent to upland agricultural fields. Within the Kankakee watershed of northwestern Indiana, a native riverine wetland was compared to a constructed riverine wetland to assess the wetland restoration in terms of water how and nitrate attenuation mechanisms and efficiency. Conditions in the constructed wetland are controlled by a system of individual cells separated by dikes and levees and into which water is periodically pumped, while the native wetland occupies an area of remnant river meanders or oxbows. Analyses of samples taken from well transects across both wetlands suggest that water flow across the constructed wetland has been greatly altered. Nitrate cycling characteristics show significant differences between the two wetlands and particularly, nitrate attenuation efficiency is greatly reduced in the constructed wetland.

AB When wetland restoration includes re-establishing native plant taxa as an objective, an understanding of the variables driving the development of plant communities is necessary. With this in mind, we examined soil and physiographic characteristics of depressional wetlands of three vegetation types (cypress-gum swamps, cypress savannas, and grass-sedge marshes) located in a fire-maintained longleaf pine ecosystem in southwestern Georgia, USA. Our objective was to establish whether plant community development in these wetlands is controlled primarily by hydrogeomorphic features or by different disturbance histories. We did not identify physical features that uniquely separate the wetland vegetation types. Instead, we observed a range of topo-edaphic conditions that likely drive variations in hydrologic regimes, which in turn, are probable influences on fire regime. We propose that several long-term successional trajectories may be initiated in the prolonged absence of fire, altered hydrology, or both, which link the distinctive vegetation types. Thus, a range of vegetation types may be suitable as potential restoration goals for these depressional wetlands. We suggest that the opportunities or constraints for use of prescribed fire in the long-term management of restored wetlands and adjacent uplands should be a significant consideration in the development of restoration strategies targeting specific plant communities.

AB We determined the life history, secondary production, and trophic basis of production for Callibaetis fluctuans in a mitigated wetland at the Green Bottom Wildlife Management Area, Cabell County, West Virginia, USA. Quantitative benthic samples were collected from three sites covering a range of water depths and vegetation types from January to December 1994. Length-frequency histograms were constructed for each sample date, and secondary production was calculated using the size-frequency method. Foregut analyses were conducted seasonally to determine diet. Callibaetis fluctuans had a multivoltine life cycle with at least three cohorts. Fast larval growth occurred during the spring and fall, whereas an overwintering cohort had slower growth. Total annual production was 208.0 mg.m(-2).yr(-1) (AFDM) with a production-to-biomass ratio of 12.6. Amorphous detritus comprised >80% of the diet in all seasons and accounted for 70% of total production. To account for this production, C. fluctuans consumed 3675 mg.m(-2).yr(-1) of detritus. This is one of the first studies to provide production estimates for an aquatic insect in a permanently inundated wetland.

AB Invertebrate assemblages were studied in eight monoculture wetland mesocosms constructed for wastewater treatment. Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (D.O.) were measured in bulrush mesocosms while higher concentrations of D.O. were measured in open water mesocosms containing submerged pond-weeds. Invertebrate taxa richness was positively related to D.O. concentrations that were, in turn, related to vegetation communities. Reference wetland sites contained a variety of plant species along with extensive open water areas. Invertebrate taxa richness was greater at reference sites than in any wastewater mesocosm. Invertebrate samples from the wastewater mesocosms and reference sites were analyzed for five trace elements. While the concentrations of aluminum, arsenic, mercury, and silver were below values harmful to wildlife, the concentrations of selenium reached levels of moderate concern on one occasion. Data from this study suggest that selenium bioaccumulation by invertebrates may be related to the type of vegetation community or detrital habitat type. Wetlands designed for invertebrate production for waterfowl should take into account the potential for low D.O. concentrations and trace element bioaccumulation associated with vegetation community types.

TI Phenol oxidase activity in peatlands in New York State: Response to
   summer drought and peat type

ID POLYPHENOL OXIDASE; SPHAGNUM; DECOMPOSITION; DEGRADATION
AB We studied phenol oxidase (PO) activity in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands and a Carex-dominated freshwater marsh during a strong summer drought in Central New York, USA to determine whether PO activity might respond to expected climatic changes. Feat was sampled at different depths and within distinct vegetation types within the marsh. Carer-derived peat supported substantially higher PO activity (average = 0.030, range = 0.011-0.051 mu MOL diqc min(-1) mg dry peat(-1), at soil pH 5.5) than Sphagnum peat (average = 0.006, range = 0.001-0.015 mu MOL diqc min(-1) mg dry peat(-1), at soil pH 3.8). In both peat types, PO activity showed a strong exponential increase with increased solution pH. Phenol oxidase activity in Sphagnum peat did not vary significantly during the drought, suggesting that PO activity may be constrained by low pH and enzyme inhibitors. Conversely, PO activity in the marsh pent varied with peat type and sample date but not as a consistent function of water-table depth. As a result, PO activity in Sphagnum peat appears to be regulated less by aeration and more by pH and possibly enzyme inhibitors. When pH is favorable, PO activity depends more on wetland vegetation type and botanical composition of the peat than climatic factors.

TI A method for coring inland, freshwater wetland soils

ID CS-137; SEDIMENTS; RATES
AB Currently, no method exists to core large volumes of inland freshwater wetland soils that maintains stratigraphic integrity, minimizes unnecessary disturbance, and cores up to a depth of 50 cm. Our objective was to create a large-volume soil coring device that could be applied with consistency to a variety of wetland substrates. The result is a hand-operated soil corer that resembles the aluminum irrigation pipe corer that DeLaune et al. (1978) used to core soft marshy substrates. Instead of aluminum pipe, we used regular steel stovepipe and a variety of tools for insertion. After the sample is extracted from the sediment, the handle can be quickly removed for ease of transportation and storage of a core. The stovepipe can be cut open to expose the soil sample so that it can easily be sectioned for incremental analysis. The corer was used to take 130 samples in 18 different sites, spanning many different wetland substrate types. Our method has many applications, including radiochronologic dating, seed bank analysis, bulk density measurement, and soil contaminants analysis.

TI Patterns of change in tree islands in Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee
   National Wildlife Refuge from 1950 to 1991
SO WETLANDS

AB Size, shape, orientation, and distribution of tree islands in a remnant of northern Everglades wetland were examined from 1950 and 1991 aerial photography. The objectives were to quantify the patterns of tree islands in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, to determine if the patterns of toe islands had changed between the two dates, and to relate the tree island patterns to modeled pre- and post-drainage hydrologic patterns. There was considerable variation in the patterns of tree islands spatially and temporally. Changes in the size and shape of tree islands from 1950 to 1991 are consistent with changes in the modeled pre- and post-drainage hydrologic patterns. Photo plots along the edges of the refuge, when hydroperiods are longer and depths deeper than they were historically, show a decrease in tree island size and in overall area of tree islands in the plots. Photo plots in the interior, where hydroperiods are shorter than they were pre-drainage, show an increase in tree island area. Overall, there is a tendency for more tree islands to be irregularly shaped in the 1991 photo plots than in the 1950 plots, a reflection of the loss of water Row, reduction of pulse magnitude, and the pending of water along the perimeter dikes. This study illustrates the importance of considering long-term changes in hydroperiod, depths, and water hows in the restoration of this area.

AB Factors affecting growth of softstem bulrush (Scirpus validus), an obligate wetland plant frequently used in subsurface-flow constructed wetlands in North America, were studied in a controlled environmental chamber. Effects of media depth (30- and 46-cm), hydraulic retention time (HRT) (2- and 6-day), and water-level drawdown (drawdown vs. no drawdown) on plant growth in 24 microcosms were investigated. Weekly root and stem growth was measured and stem health assessed to determine effects of treatments on plant vigor. Water-level drawdown was detrimental to plant growth, increasing the percentage of dead stems. Stem production was higher in microcosms with a 46-cm media depth than those with a 30-cm depth and also higher in microcosms that were permanently flooded than in those with fluctuating water levels. Root production was greater in microcosms with a 30-cm media depth than in those with a 46-cm depth, and root production was also greater in microcosms that were constantly hooded than in those drawn down. Scirpus validus is a robust plant that grows well in gravel media microcosms; however, problems are experienced when rhizomes and roots dry out during water drainage.

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PREFERENTIAL FLOW; ECOSYSTEM; STREAM
AB Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, and hydraulic conductivity were examined in 56 sediment cores collected from a small lotic wetland in the Talladega Wetland Ecosystem (Hale County, Alabama, USA). All sediment characteristics varied spatially across the wetland. A distinctive demarcation in sediment characteristics occurred between the upper (0 to 30-cm) and lower (30 to 80-cm) depths. Sediments in the upper 30-cm contained a higher percentage of clay than deeper sediments and had high hydraulic conductivities (0.5 to 1100 cm d(-1)). Lower sediment depths contained greater percentages of silt and sand, but greater sediment compaction and lower organic matter concentrations resulted in low hydraulic conductivities (1 x 10(-3) to 55 cm d(-1)). Higher organic matter and lower bulk density occurred in the sediments of vegetated areas of the wetland compared to the areas near the inflow and outflow streams. Organic matter was higher and more variable (2 to 38% sediment dry weight) within the upper 30 cm of sediments and decreased significantly with depth (r(2) = 0.51). In the lower sediments (30 to 80-cm depth), organic matter was lower and less variable (2 to 10% sediment dry weight). Sediment bulk density increased with increased sediment depth (r(2) = 0.77) and was lower in vegetated areas (0.2 to 1.0 g cm(-3)) compared to the inflow and outflow stream sediments (0.6 to 1.4 g cm(-3)).

AB Although the importance of hydrology to wetland ecosystem productivity is recognized, there are few detailed analyses of shallow subsurface water flow (<1 m depth) through wetland ecosystems. Shallow subsurface water flow paths and average linear velocity were quantified with nested lysimeters in a riverine wetland located in Hale County, AL. Water-table elevation was spatially and temporally variable and was directly correlated to precipitation at the wetland. In the beginning portion of the study (May to November 1996), average monthly precipitation was 73 mm and water-table elevation decreased across much of the wetland. From December 1996 through July 1997, average monthly precipitation increased to 110 mm with a concomitant increase in water-table elevation throughout the wetland. During periods of low average monthly precipitation, wetland subsurface water was recharged from the hyporheic zone of the main inflow stream (northern side of the wetland). With increased precipitation, subsurface water recharge shifted from the stream hyporheos to recharge from an upgradient area (entire northern portion of the wetland) dominated by alder, Alnus serrulata. Horizontal and vertical average linear velocity was greatest in the upper 20 cm of the wetland compared to lower sediment depths. Vertical average linear velocity was similar among most sample intervals and was not correlated to antecedent precipitation. In laboratory mesocosm experiments, evapotranspiration by the emergent macrophyte Juncus effusus increased the rate of subsurface water flow in mesocosms with sand sediments, while there was no macrophyte effect in mesocosms with predominantly clay sediments.

AB Hydrology and water quality distributions in a Louisiana forested waste-water treatment wetland were studied under four different hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Pond discharge, surface-water elevations, and fluorescent dye travel times were recorded to assess surface-water hydrology, and water samples were collected for nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and suspended solids analyses. Wetted surface area increased with pond discharge rate, and 58 to 66 percent of surface-water flow was concentrated in shallow channels covering only 10 to 12 percent of the total study area. Water residence times were much longer (0.9 to 1.1 days) than minimum dye travel times (2 to 3 hours) through the 4-hectare study area. Relative to study area influent concentrations, study area outflow concentrations of nitrate and total and organic suspended solids were lower, ammonium was higher, and phosphate was generally unchanged. However, there was an increase in concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate within 50 m of the study area inflow location. Ammonium and phosphate did decrease from these peak concentrations. Net nitrate production was observed within 50 m of the pond outfall and was probably due to nitrification. Net nitrate removal was observed beyond this distance and ranged up to 0.10 . g . m(-2) . d(-1) probably due primarily to denitrification. In general, nitrate removal rates increased linearly with changes in nitrate loading rates. Results show that nutrient distributions are linked to hydrology. Higher pond discharge rates created more treatment surface area, and higher constituent loading rates produced higher removal rates. Therefore, discharge rates could be manipulated, and physical control structures could be installed to increase wetted surface area and increase removal efficiency within the wetland. Higher loading rates could then be processed without requiring significant increases in treatment area.

AB The placement of wetland restoration projects in a landscape to optimize the functional performance of wetlands on a regional scale is often overlooked. To address this problem, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Landscape Function Project developed the synoptic approach to assign restoration priority to landscape subunits according to selected functional criteria. The approach provides a flexible, ecologically-based framework for allocating limited restoration-resources and preserving valued wetland functions on a landscape scale. We conducted a synoptic assessment of the Prairie Pothole Region of the northcentral U.S. to demonstrate application of the method for our assessment criterion-the marginal decrease in total downstream flood volume per restoration dollar. A criterion is often not directly measurable but can be represented by an index composed of measurements on related variables. In a synoptic assessment, these measured variables, referred to as indicators, are limited to variables for which data are existing, accessible, and uniformly available for the entire region. We developed a conceptual model to guide the development of an index of the assessment criterion. We then ranked landscape subunits based on index values and mapped the ranks to show relative priority for restoration among landscape subunits. We conducted a series of analyses to justify selection of indicators and some of our assumptions. The approach offers multiple options for processing and displaying information for use by wetland managers.

AB We studied the relationship between benthic invertebrates and aquatic birds at a newly constructed wetland using an avian exclosure experiment combined with counts of aquatic bird use. We measured the standing stock biomass of benthic dipterans both inside and outside exclosures. Chironomidae was the most abundant dipteran family present. Maximum chironomid standing stock biomass per pond ranged from 3.62 to 27.82 g/m(2) and was comparable to that found in a number of natural systems. We monitored the abundance of ten aquatic birds species. Abundances of three aquatic bird species [American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), and cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera)] were significantly correlated with chironomid and total dipteran densities. Our experiment, however found no significant effect of predation on invertebrate densities.

Results from field investigations indicated that elevated concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were associated with growth of filamentous bacteria on insect body surfaces and that there were significantly fewer mayflies (Ephemeroptera) in the nutrient-enriched wetland. Laboratory investigations confirmed a strong linkage between bacterial growth and reduced survival of mayflies. Survival was examined for individuals with bacterial infestation ranging from 0% to 60% body coverage. A threshold for catastrophic mortality was present at about the 25% level of coverage; there were very few survivors above that level. Based on these findings, the diagnostic endpoint for the bioindicator is 25% body coverage by bacterial growth, a level that signifies major differences in insect populations in the field and is also easy to detect visually. This study provides evidence that the insect-bacteria bioindicator is a reliable tool for assessing nutrient impacts on wetland macroinvertebrate communities. The bioindicator could be useful in the development of a Wetland Bioassessment Protocol.

   wetlands
AB Forest removal represents one of the large-scale ecosystem disturbances that concern water quality degradation, species composition change, and wildlife habitat alteration along the Florida coast. We conducted a five-year study with the objective to address effects of two forest management scenarios on the water regimes of cypress-pine flatwoods ecosystems in the lower coastal plain. Three experimental blocks (16-21 ha) were used in this study, with one representing control (C), one wetlands-harvest-only (W), and one wetlands + uplands harvest (ALL). Within the center of each block, a representative cypress wetland and its surrounding pine upland were extensively instrumented to quantify the changes of each hydrologic variable induced by tree removal. Water levels in cypress wetlands in both treatment areas were significantly elevated about 32-41 cm on average, and outflow doubled in the five-month dry period immediately following the tree harvesting. The ground-water table in the upland was also raised by about 29 cm on average due to ALL, but it was not affected significantly during the entire post-treatment period by W. During wet periods, the: treatment effects for both wetlands and uplands were not significant. Causes for spatial and temporal variability of hydrologic responses to forest harvesting are speculated to be 1) total evapotranspiration does not change significantly in flatwoods after tree removal during wet seasons; 2) specific yield of the flatwoods soils is variable in time and space; and 3) lateral water movement from uplands to wetlands. From this study, we conclude that harvesting both uplands and wetlands causes greater response than harvesting wetlands only. The impacts lasted for more than two years but were most pronounced only in the dry periods. Temporal and spatial variations of each hydrologic component should be considered in evaluating the hydrologic impact of forest management on the flatwoods landscape.

AB In five tributary streams (four inflowing and one outflowing) of 1600-ha Trout Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, we examined factors that can affect the magnitude of stream flow and transport of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) through the streams to the lake. One catchment, the Allequash Creek basin, was investigated in more detail to describe the dynamics of carbon flow and to identify potential carbon sources. Stream flows and carbon loads showed little or no relation to surface-water catchment area. They were more closely related to ground-water watershed area because ground-water discharge, from both local and regional sources, is a major contributor to the hydrologic budgets of these catchments. An important factor in determining carbon influx to the stream is the area of peatland in the catchment. Peatland porewaters contain DOC concentrations up to 40 mg l(-1) and are a significant potential carbon source. Ground-water discharge and lateral flow through peat are the suspected mechanisms for transport of that carbon to the streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested that the sources of DOC in Allequash Creek above Allequash Lake were wetland vegetation and peat and that the sources below Allequash Lake were filamentous algae and wild rice. Catchments with high proportions of peatland, including the Allequash Creek catchment, tended to have elevated DOC loads in outflowing stream water. Respiration and carbon mineralization in lakes within the system tend to produce low DOC and low DOC/DIC in lake outflows, especially at Trout Lake. In Allequash Lake, however, the shallow peat island and vegetation-filled west end were sources of DOC. Despite the vast carbon reservoir in the peatlands, carbon yields were very low in these catchments. Maximum yields were on the order of 2.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DOC and 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DIC. The small yields were attributable to low stream flows due to lack of significant overland runoff and very limited stream channel coverage of the total catchment area.

AB We described the vegetation of two alluvial swamp forest stands along Durham Creek in Beaufort County, North Carolina, USA in relation to elevation, hydrologic, and edaphic gradients. Over 3,000 surveyed elevations of individual plant microsites were used in conjunction with 26 years of stream gage data to examine individual species responses to annual and growing season flooding frequencies. Direct gradient analyses combined with plot ordinations derived from detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis suggested that differences in vegetation between the stands were primarily the result of variations in elevation, growing season flooding frequency, percent base saturation, exchangeable acidity, and soil physical properties. Although the stands were less than 4.5 km apart and without significant intermediate tributaries, growing season flooding frequency and duration were magnified in the lowest elevations of the downstream stand. An elevation difference of as little as 10 cm resulted in a 20% difference in the frequency of surface flooding during the growing season. Species distributions were significantly correlated with depth to mottling (r(2) = 0.75), flooding frequency (r(2) = -0.57), elevation (r(2) = 0.70), and several soil chemical properties. The two stands had very similar annual surface flooding regimes, but subtle differences in growing season flooding frequency, soil characteristics, and disturbance history have apparently resulted in dissimilar plant community composition and structure. These results suggest that the lack of quantitative data on vegetation-environment interactions occurring at the microtopographic scale (10(-1) m) in alluvial swamp forests makes precise prediction, planning, or design of created or restored wetland composition and function a formidable challenge.

TI Effects of measurement frequency on water-level summary statistics

   statistics; monthly mean water level; 14-day exceedance; sampling design
ID SCALE
AB Wetland scientists and managers recognize the need to characterize hydrology for understanding wetland ecosystems. Hydrologic data, however, are not routinely collected in wetlands, in part because of a lack of knowledge about how to effectively measure hydrologic attributes and how frequently to measure water levels. To determine how measurement interval affects interpretation of water-level data, we analyzed data from seven wetlands in Oregon and Pennsylvania. We created subsets of daily data for each wetland, with measurement intervals of 2 to 28 days, then compared those subsets to the daily data for annual water-level summary statistics, monthly mean water levels, and occurrence/duration of threshold conditions (e.g., water in the root zone). Our primary goal was to determine if sampling at low frequencies can provide representative water-level data and accurate perceptions of the occurrence of water levels above thresholds. For annual water-level distributions, small data sets from 28-day measurement intervals provided summary data (e.g., median, quartiles, range) comparable to the 1-day reference data. For measurement intervals of seven days or less, average errors in estimates of stage (minimum, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) were less than or equal to 0.03 m; for a 28-day interval, average errors were <0.05 m. Errors in estimates of maximum stage were considerably larger (0.11 m and 0.21 m for 7- and 28-day intervals, respectively) but can be circumvented using crest gauges. Errors in estimates of monthly mean stage varied greatly with measurement frequency (1-4% error for 7-day intervals, 5-15% error using one measurement per month), among wetlands and from month to month. Water-level durations above threshold values were problematic; for measurement intervals of 2 days and longer, 14-day exceedances of water in the root zone were frequently missed or spurious exceedance periods were identified. Overall, results show that sampling at monthly intervals, supplemented with crest gauges, provides a representative description of annual water-level distributions for use in classifying and comparing wetlands. More frequent sampling is required to characterize water levels for shorter (e.g., monthly) time periods and to reliably identify exceedance periods for water above threshold levels. More generally, the results remind us that the frequency and duration of sampling in hydrologic studies must be designed to ensure that data will support planned analyses.

AB Dead, downed wood is an important component of upland forest and aquatic ecosystems, but its role in wetland ecosystems, including mangroves, is poorly understood. We measured downed wood in ten sites on the western Pacific islands of Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap, all located within the Federated States of Micronesia. Our goals were to examine patterns of variability in the quantity of downed wood in these mangrove ecosystems, provide a general characterization of downed wood in a region with no previously published accounts, and investigate the relationship between harvesting practices and the amount of downed wood. The overall mean volume of downed wood at our study sites was estimated to be 60.8 m(3) ha(-1) (20.9 t ha(-1)), which is greater than most published data for forested wetlands. There were significant differences among islands, with the sites on Kosrae (104.2 m(3) ha(-1)) having a much greater mean volume of downed wood than those on Pohnpei (43.1 m(3) ha(-1)) or Yap (35.1 m(3) ha(-1)). Part of the difference among islands may be attributable to differences in stand age and structure, but the most important factor seems to be the greater amount of wood harvesting on Kosrae, coupled with a low efficiency of use of cut trees. Of a total of 45 cut trees examined on Kosrae, no wood had been removed from 18 (40%); these are believed to be trees cut down because other, more valuable, trees were caught on them as they were felled. Of the other 27 trees, only 24 to 42% of the stem volume (to a 10 cm top) was removed from the forest, the amount varying by species. The impacts of current harvesting practices are unknown but may include important effects on tree regeneration and the abundance and species composition of crab populations.

AB Nutrient properties of wetlands are primary evaluated by soil chemical analysis. Therefore, appropriately collecting and storing waterlogged soil samples is crucial to accurately representing in situ soil-nutrient conditions. A west Texas playa wetland and surrounding outerbasin soils were sampled to compare the effects of three soil storage techniques on various chemical constituents. Techniques evaluated were the following: (1) drying at room temperature, (2) freezing, and (3) purging with nitrogen gas. Drying and freezing are typical methods used in storing terrestrial soils. We hypothesized that the purging technique would facilitate an anaerobic environment and inhibit aerobic chemical transformations. Soils were analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NO3 + NO2-N, NH4-N, extractable P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, and pH. Values for NO3 + NO2-N and Cu were significantly greater in dried samples than both frozen and purged samples, and generally were significantly lower in pH. Based on this study, we recommend that wetland soils not be dried before analysis.

AB The Everglades crayfish (Procambarus alleni Faxon) is the only species reported from Everglades National Park (ENP) and Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY). However, we identified a second species, Procambarus fallax (Hagen), from those locations. Reexamination of archived samples showed that P. fallax had been collected as early as 1985 but had been misidentified or overlooked; therefore, we provide methods for distinguishing live and preserved specimens of these morphologically similar species. Species relative abundance varied predictably with hydroperiod (length of inundation) both in recent collections and in archived samples. Procambarus fallax relative abundance was highest in sites characterized by long hydroperiod and prolonged inundation, whereas P. alleni was the lone species in short hydroperiod marshes.

AB Studies have documented the flora, fauna, and soils of ground-water fed wetlands, but very little is known about their plant-mycorrhizal associations. This study was designed to determine the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in several wetland plant species associated with fens in west central Ohio, USA. Roots of wetland plant species collected at four sites had mycorrhizal fungal colonization levels ranging from 0 to 61.5%. Mycorrhizal associations occurred in plants of all wetland categories (OBL, FACW, FAC). We propose that these peatlands have lower nutrient availability than some other wetlands and thus may be more dependent on these root fungi for nutrient uptake. Mycorrhizal fungi may be an important consideration in the functional restoration of ground-water driven wetland systems.

TI A surface-associated activity trap for capturing water-surface and
   aquatic invertebrates in wetlands
SO WETLANDS

DT Article

ID MARSHES; POWER; FISH
AB We developed a surface-associated activity trap (SAT) for sampling aquatic invertebrates in wetlands. We compared performance of this trap with that of a conventional activity trap (AT) based on nondetection rates and relative abundance estimates for 13 taxa of common wetland invertebrates and for taxon richness using data from experiments in constructed wetlands. Taxon-specific non-detection rates for ATs generally exceeded those of SATs, and largest improvements using SATs were for Chironomidae and Gastropoda. SATs were efficient at capturing cladocera, Chironomidae, Gastropoda, total Crustacea, and multiple taxa (taxon richness) but were only slightly better than ATs at capturing Dytiscidae. Temporal differences in capture rates were observed only for cladocera, Chironomidae, Dytiscidae, and total Crustacea, with capture efficiencies of SATs usually decreasing from mid-June through mid-July for these taxa. We believe that SATs may be useful for characterizing wetland invertebrate communities and for developing improved measures of prey available to foraging waterfowl and other aquatic birds.

AB The insectivorous tree swallow was chosen as an indicator species to investigate the uptake of pulp mill-related chlorinated hydrocarbons from emergent aquatic insects. Nest box populations were monitored for reproductive success at locations upstream and downstream of pulp mills on two river systems in British Columbia, Canada. Also, 16-day-old nestlings were collected and analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), pesticides, chlorophenols and chloroguaiacols. Most reproductive parameters were not different between populations at upstream and downstream locations, and were equivalent to or greater than those recorded for other tree swallow populations. Chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination of nestlings was low at all sites. The highest tissue concentrations were detected downstream of pulp mills on the Fraser River, where PCDD and PCDF patterns along with the presence of pentachlorophenol (PCP) suggested that the primary source of contaminants was past use of PCP for timber preservation. Although the absolute tissue concentration of contaminants was less, the toxic concentration (as estimated with I-TEQs) was greatest in nestlings downstream of a pulp mill on the Thompson River. The proportionately larger contributions from 2,3,7,8-TCDF and PCB-77 elevated these TEQs in comparison to other populations. Nest success was the one reproductive measure that showed substantial reductions in downstream populations on both rivers; however, there was little indication that nest failures were the direct result of contamination. Failures were largely due to parental abandonment, and, while poor parental attentiveness and nest abandonment have been associated with chlorinated hydrocarbon tissue concentrations in other studies, our 1-year assessment was insufficient to establish any link with pulp mill effluent exposure. Nestling growth models showed some subtle differences in growth patterns between nest box populations on the two rivers, but an association with pulp mill effects on aquatic insect prey availability was not established.

AB Atrazine was amended into constructed wetlands (59-73 x 14 x 0.3 m) for the purpose of monitoring transport and fate of the pesticide to obtain information necessary to provide future design parameters for constructed wetlands mitigation of agricultural runoff. Following pesticide amendment, a simulated storm and runoff event equal to three volume additions was imposed on each wetland. Targeted atrazine concentrations were 0 mu g/l (unamended control), 73 mu g/l, and 147 mu g/l. Water, sediment, and plant samples were collected weekly for 35 days from transects longitudinally distributed throughout each wetland and were analyzed for atrazine using gas chromatography. Between 17 and 42% of measured atrazine mass was within the first 30-36 m of wetlands. Atrazine was below detection limits (0.05 mu g/kg) in all sediment and plant samples collected throughout the duration of this study. Aqueous half lives ranged from 16 to 48 days. According to these data, conservative buffer travel distances of 100-280 m would be necessary for effective runoff mitigation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this study we report the levels of organochlorine compounds in eggs of aquatic birds from the Danube Delta, a major European wetland. The eggs were collected in 1997 and belonged to the following species: the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the greylag goose (Anser anser), the mute swan (Cygnus olor), the coot (Fulica atra), the glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), the spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), the little egret (Egretta garzetta), the night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the grey heron (Ardea cinerea), the great white egret (Egretta alba), the red-necked grebe (Podiceps griseus), the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), the Pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus) and the common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) levels were higher in eggs of the little egret, the great white egret, the cormorant and the Pygmy cormorant with respect to the other species (48,399, 13,613, 12,400 and 10,417 ng/g dry wt., respectively). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) levels were lower than 1393 ng/g dry wt. in all species while polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in the Pygmy cormorant (2565 ng/g dry wt.) were higher than in the other species. The toxicity evaluation was based on 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent factors (TEF) and non-ortho PCB congeners contributed much more than mono-ortho PCBs in most of species. A further aim of this study was to evaluate the possible differences of organochlorine levels in bird eggs collected in the same area in 1982 and in 1997; generally speaking the levels detected in the latter period were lower than those detected in the earlier one.

AB One of the pressing problems for applied ecologists is the efficient restoration of structure and function to degraded ecosystems. Where some other conservation activities, such as protection of existing wilderness, continue to require making the best of increasingly bad situations, the goal of restoration raises the pleasing prospect of measurable improvement in landscapes. Restoration simultaneously provides the ultimate test for the discipline of community ecology: ecologists should be able to build an ecosystem in the same way an engineer builds a bridge, with a list of parts connected in specified ways leading to certain reliable outcomes. Failures would reveal that scientists do not adequately understand the system. Practical considerations suggest the application of tools that already exist rather than the invention of new ones. The objective of this paper is to suggest that two valuable tools may already exist, tools that provide an intellectual foundation for restoration ecology. Such a foundation is necessary because there has been a tendency for restoration ecology to represent a haphazard collection of individual cases rather than a well-defined discipline with repeatable methods. One possible scheme for unifying studies of restoration is that provided by assembly rules, where predictions are based upon key environmental factors and the responses of species to those factors. The potential of such assembly rules is introduced using three examples: fish in wetlands, plants in salt marshes, and plants in prairie potholes. I then describe an experiment where a standard species pool of wetland plants was sown into twenty-four different sets of environmental conditions, illustrating how landscapes can select communities out of larger pools. A second possible tool is indicators of ecosystem integrity. These can measure whether a project actually works. Clear discrimination between success and failure can improve restoration procedures by accelerating the evolution of management principles and techniques; Holling has called this process 'adaptive environmental assessment.' I conclude with the optimistic view that restoration already has the tools for continued progress; what is needed is primarily their intelligent application. That is, rather than ending with a typically academic plea for more research, I suggest (for a change) char what is needed is only the discriminating application of procedures and principles that already exist.

AB The spread of invasive taxa, including Lythrum salicaria, Typha x glauca, Myriophyllum spicatum, Phalaris arundinacea, and Phragmites australis, has dramatically changed the vegetation of many wetlands of North America. Three theories have been advanced to explain the nature of plant invasiveness. Aggressive growth during geographic expansion could result because 1) growth is more favorable under new environmental conditions than those of resident locales (environmental constraints hypothesis); 2) herbivores may be absent in the new locale, resulting in selection of genotypes with improved competitive ability and reduced allocation to herbivore defenses (evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis); and 3) interspecific hybridization occurred between a new taxon and one existing in an area, resulting in novel phenotypes with selective advantages in disturbed sites or phenotypes that can grow under conditions not favorable for either parent (introgression/hybrid speciation hypothesis). A review of published literature found few studies that compare the growth and dynamics of invasive populations in their new range versus those in historic ranges. However, there is evidence that hydrologic alterations could facilitate invasions by Typha x glauca and Phalaris arundinacea and that increased salinity promoted spread of Typha angustifolia (parental taxon) and Phragmites australis. The potential for reduced herbivory causing aggressive growth is greatest for Lythrum salicaria. Introgressive hybridization is potentially a cause of invasiveness for all five species but has been established only for Typha x glauca and Lythrum salicaria.

AB To better understand how to establish Carex species from seed in created and restored wetlands, a series of experimental studies was conducted on Carex seed and seedlings. These studies included (1) the effect of seed age (1 to 18 months after collection) on viability and germination, (2) storage conditions (+4, -4 or +4/-4 degrees C; wet or dry) on seed germination, (3) soil moisture on seed germination, and (4) soil amendments (fertilizer, topsoil, and compost) on seedling recruitment and growth. Seeds of Carex species of several provenances would not germinate to any appreciable extent once they were more than six months old. For Carex aquatilis, germination could be increased by storing its seed at either 4 degrees C or -4 degrees C. For Carex lacustris and Carex stricta, seed germination decreased significantly, by about 50 to 100% in all 8 storage treatments. Germination of Carex stipata seed was highest in 1 cm of standing water, and its seed did not germinate in the driest soil moisture treatment. Carex stricta seed germination was not affected very much by soil moistures. No Carex spp. were recruited from seed in any of the field soil-amendment treatment plots. In both the greenhouse and field, the addition of compost, topsoil, and fertilizer increased the growth of Carex stricta In a greenhouse study, above ground, below ground, and total dry mass increased linearly with the percent compost added. Our results suggest that the probability of establishing Carex spp. from seed in created and restored wetlands in the Upper Midwest would be maximized by using fresh seed, preferably seed produced earlier in the same growing season; by keeping soil moisture levels as high as possible; and by raising the soil's organic matter content, if need be, through the use of suitable soil amendments to levels found in natural sedge meadows.

AB Diatoms were employed to assess the recovery of northern prairie wetlands restored after drainage. We predicted that diatom species diversity and equitability are lower in restored wetlands than in reference wetlands and that diatom communities are similar among reference wetlands because communities should be relatively stable over time. Conversely, we predicted that diatom communities in restored and reference wetlands differ because species recovery after restoration may be incomplete or unattainable depending on environmental conditions or dispersal limits. Eight undisturbed, unrestored (reference) wetlands were compared to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatom communities on artificial substrates were transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and vice versa to test for environmental control and dispersal limits to community composition. Species richness was similar at restored and reference wetlands. Diversity and equitability at restored and reference sites were similar within a sampling period, but diversity and equitability decreased over the growing season in reference sites. Based on multidimensional scaling analyses, restored and reference sites could not be distinguished by species composition either early or late in the season. Transplanted diatom community assemblages became similar to those in the wetlands to which they were transferred, suggesting a strong environmental control over diatom assemblages. Diatoms, as a whole, responded rapidly to environmental conditions; yet, dispersal still may limit some species' re-establishment, while resistance to disturbance may produce little response among other diatom species. Diatoms may have limited utility as ecological indicators in prairie wetlands because of the unique interaction between diatom life history and the cyclic hydrology of; prairie wetlands and because diatom community structure is highly variable among reference wetlands.

AB The cumulative effects of human actions on wetland ecosystems motivate current efforts at wetland restoration. They also have created in part the context within which restorations are undertaken. Using modern hydrogeological understanding of wetland-landscape linkages, I argue that restorations should begin with a cumulative impact analysis for the entire region in which the restoration is proposed. The analysis, however, should not focus merely on number of hectares of wetlands lost or degraded. It should be based on the concept of templates for wetland development. These templates are the diversity of settings created in specific landscapes by the complex interactions of hydrogeologic factors and climate. They control key hydrologic variables and hydrologically influenced chemical variables that cause specific wetland types to form and to be maintained through time. They also determine in large part the biogeochemical cycling characteristics specific to different types of wetlands. They thus account for both the biological and functional diversity of wetlands. A cumulative impact assessment for restoration purposes should identify the kinds, numbers, relative abundances, and spatial distribution of wetland templates in a region-both past and present. These past and present profiles of the wetland landscape can be used to make decisions regarding the type and location of restorations. Matching type and location to the appropriate hydrogeologic setting will maximize the probability of success for individual projects. Regional wetland diversity can be restored if individual restoration decisions about wetland type and location are made in light of the diversity of templates in past and present regional profiles.

AB Wetland coverage and type distributions vary systematically by ecoregion across the Great Lakes Basin. Land use and subsequent changes in wetland type distributions also vary among ecoregions. Incidence of wetland disturbance varies significantly within ecoregions but tends to increase from north to south with intensity of land use. Although the nature of disturbance activities varies by predominant land-use type, mechanisms of impact and potential response endpoints appear to be similar across agricultural and urban areas. Based on the proportion of associated disturbance activities and proportion response endpoints affected, the highest ranking mechanisms of impact are sedimentation/turbidity, retention time, eutrophication, and changes in hydrologic timing. Disturbance activities here are defined as events that cause wetland structure or function to vary outside of a normal range, while stressors represent the individual internal or external agents (causes) that act singly or in combination to impair one or more wetland functions. Responses most likely associated with disturbance activities based on shared mechanisms of impact are 1) shifts in plant species composition, 2) reduction in wildlife production, 3) decreased local or regional biodiversity, 4) reduction in fish and/or other secondary production, 5) increased flood peaks/frequency, 6) increased aboveground production, 7) decreased water quality downstream, and 8) loss of aquatic plant species with high light compensation points. General strategies and goals for wetland restoration can be derived at the ecoregion scale using information on current and historic wetland extent and type distributions and the distribution of special-concern species dependent on specific wetland types or mosaics of habitat types. Restoration of flood-control and water-quality improvement functions will require estimates of wetland coverage relative to total land area or specific land uses (e.g., deforestation, urbanization) at the watershed scale. The high incidence of disturbance activities in the more developed southern ecoregions of both Canada and the U.S. is reflected in the loss of species across all wetland types. The species data here suggest that an effective regional strategy must include restoration of a diversity of wetland types, including the rarer wetland types (wet meadows, fens), as well as forested swamps, which were extensive historically. The prevalence of anthropogenic stresses and openwater habitats likely contributes to the concentration of exotic species in inland wetlands of the southern Great Lakes ecoregions. Vegetation removal and site disturbance are the best-documented causes for plant invasions, and encroachment activities are common in marshes and ponds of the southern ecoregions.

AB Gauging the impact of manipulative activities, such as rehabilitation or management, on wetlands requires having a notion of the unmanipulated condition as a reference. An understanding of the reference condition requires knowledge of dominant factors influencing ecosystem processes and biological communities. In this paper, we focus on natural physical factors (conditions and processes) that drive coastal wetland ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Great Lakes coastal wetlands develop under conditions of large-lake hydrology and disturbance imposed at a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales and contain biotic communities adapted to unstable and unpredictable conditions. Coastal wetlands are configured along a continuum of hydrogeomorphic types: open coastal wetlands, drowned river mouth and flooded delta wetlands, and protected wetlands, each developing distinct ecosystem properties and biotic communities. Hydrogeomorphic factors associated with the lake and watershed operate at a hierarchy of scales: a) local and short-term (seiches and ice action), b) watershed / lakewide / annual (seasonal water- level change), and c) larger or year-to-year and longer (regional and/or greater than one-year). Other physical factors include the unique water quality features of each lake. The aim of this paper is to provide scientists and managers with a framework for considering regional and site-specific geomorphometry and a hierarchy of physical processes in planning management and conservation projects.

AB A long history of human-induced degradation of Great Lakes wetlands has made restoration a necessity, but the practice of wetland restoration is relatively new, especially in large lake systems. Therefore, we compiled tested methods and developed additional potential methods based on scientific understanding of Great Lakes wetland ecosystems to provide an overview of approaches for restoration. We addressed this challenge by focusing on four general fields of science: hydrology, sedimentology, chemistry, and biology. Hydrologic remediation methods include restoring hydrologic connections between diked and hydrologically altered wetlands and the lakes, restoring water tables lowered by ditching, and restoring natural variation in lake levels of regulated lakes Superior and Ontario. Sedimentological remediation methods include management of sediment input from uplands, removal or proper management of dams on tributary rivers, and restoration of protective barrier beaches and sand spits. Chemical remediation methods include reducing or eliminating inputs of contaminants from point and non-point sources, natural sediment remediation by biodegradation and chemical degradation, and active sediment remediation by removal or by in situ treatment. Biological remediation methods include control of non-target organisms, enhancing populations of target organisms, and enhancing habitat for target organisms. Some of these methods were used in three major restoration projects (Metzger Marsh on Lake Erie and Cootes Paradise and Oshawa Second Marsh on Lake Ontario), which are described as case studies to show practical applications of wetland restoration in the Great Lakes. Successful restoration techniques that do not require continued manipulation must be founded in the basic tenets of ecology and should mimic natural processes. Success is demonstrated by the sustainability, productivity, nutrient-retention ability, invasibility, and biotic interactions within a restored wetland.

AB Historical and geospatial data were used to identify the relationships between water levels, wetland vegetation, littoral drift of sediments, and the condition of a protective barrier beach at Metzger Marsh, a coastal wetland in western Lake Erie, to enhance and guide a joint federal and state wetland restoration project. Eleven sets of large-scale aerial photographs dating from 1940 through 1994 were interpreted to delineate major vegetation types and boundaries of the barrier beach. A geographic information system (GIS) was then used to digitize the data and calculate the vegetated area and length of barrier beach. Supplemented by paleoecological and sedimentological analyses, aerial photographic interpretation revealed that Metzger Marsh was once a drowned-river-mouth wetland dominated by sedges and protected by a sand barrier beach. Extremely high water levels, storm events, and reduction of sediments in the littoral drift contributed to the complete destruction of the barrier beach in 1973 and prevented its recovery. The extent of wetland vegetation, correlated to water levels and condition of the barrier beach, decreased from a high of 108 ha in 1940 to a low of 33 ha in 1994. The lack of an adequate sediment supply and low probability of a period of extremely low lake levels in the near future made natural reestablishment of the barrier beach and wetland vegetation unlikely. Therefore, the federal and state managers chose to construct a dike to replace the protective barrier beach. Recommendations stemming from this historical analysis, however, resulted in the incorporation of a water-control structure In the dike that will retain a hydrologic connection between wetland and lake. Management of the wetland will seek to mimic processes natural to the wetland type identified by this analysis.

AB The biota of aquatic systems are integrators of overall habitat quality, revealing both episodic as well as cumulative disturbance, and therefore are able to serve as natural monitors of the systems they inhabit. Invertebrate communities from three relatively pristine coastal wetlands located along the northern shore of Lake Huron were compared to those from three relatively impacted Saginaw Bay coastal wetlands in Lake Huron to identify components of the community that could ordinate wetlands according to anthropogenic disturbance. A total of 24 potential metrics were examined for each of four vegetation zones at the study sites. Of these, 14 successfully discriminated between sites and were used to generate a preliminary index of biotic integrity (IBI) for Lake Huron coastal wetlands. This IBI was then tested by assessing coastal wetlands, including five additional sites, based on invertebrate data collected the following year. The preliminary IBI seemed to provide an accurate depiction of the wetlands used to generate the IBI as well as the five additional wetlands. We do not recommend use of the presented IBI as the definitive assessment tool for Lake Huron coastal wetlands. Instead, we suggest that it be tested further on a series of wetlands with known degrees of anthropogenic disturbance.

ID FISH
AB Restoration plans for Metzger Marsh, a coastal wetland on the south shore of western Lake Erie, incorporated a fish-control system designed to restrict access to the wetland by large common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Ingress fish passageways in the structure contain slots into which experimental grates of varying size and shape can be placed to selectively allow entry and transfer of other large fish species while minimizing the number of common carp to be handled. We tested different sizes and shapes of grates in experimental tanks in the laboratory to determine the best design for testing in the field. We also tested northern pike (Esox lucius) because lack of access to wetland spawning habitat has greatly reduced their populations in western Lake Erie. Based on our results, vertical bar grates were chosen for installation because common carp were able to pass through circular grates smaller than body height by compressing their soft abdomens; they passed through rectangular grates on the diagonal. Vertical bar grates with 5-cm spacing that were installed across much of the control structure should limit access of common carp larger than 34 cm total length (TL) and northern pike larger than 70 cm. Vertical bar grates selected for initial field trials in the fish passageway had spacings of 5.8 and 6.6 cm, which increased access by common carp to 40 and 47 cm TL and by northern pike to 76 and 81 cm, respectively. The percentage of potential common carp biomass (fish seeking entry) that must be handled in lift baskets in the passageway increased from 0.9 to 4.8 to 15.4 with each increase in spacing between bars. Further increases in spacing would greatly increase the number of common carp that would have to be handled. The results of field testing should be useful in designing selective fish-control systems for other wetland restoration sites adjacent to large water bodies.

AB Landscape profiles describing the pattern of the diversity of wetlands in a region can serve as a standard for characterizing the resource and quantifying the effects of management decisions. We used hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification to generate landscape profiles to evaluate the effects of mitigation in the rapidly urbanizing area of Portland, Oregon, USA. The profiles were produced from information on the types, numbers, and relative abundances of wetlands by HGM class. Using field data, topographic maps, and National Wetland Inventory maps, we classified 45 naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) into regional HGM classes (depression, riverine, slope, and lacustrine fringe) and developed the corresponding landscape profile (the NOW-Profile). We then classified 51 mitigation wetlands (MWs) and added them to the profile (the All Site-Profile) to examine changes in the regional wetland resource. The classification of MWs required development of new, atypical HGM classes to describe the unique combinations of site morphology and landscape setting found in these wetlands: depression-in-riverine-setting, in-stream-depression, and depression-in-slope-setting. Comparison of the landscape profiles showed that the structure and settings of NOWs and MWs are very different. Most NOWs fell into the regional HGM classes (91%), but most MWs fit the atypical classes (75%). Most NOWs were riverine wetlands (56%), whereas most MWs were depressions in-riverine-setting and in-stream-depressions (33% for each class). The All Site-Profile showed an increase in the proportion of wetlands with depressional morphology, comprised mostly of MWs. Results also showed that the majority (71%) of MWs were constructed, at least partially, within existing NOWs through an exchange of wetland types and that most of these MWs (86%) belonged to the atypical classes. The approach used shows that the cumulative effects of wetland management decisions can be discerned effectively through HGM classification and development of landscape profiles. Although our results are important in documenting the landscape changes taking place in a specific region through mitigation, our approach is generally applicable for evaluating wetland management decisions and helping resource managers to make better-informed, broad-based decisions about the wetland resource.

AB Hydrologic data are essential for understanding relationships between wetland morphology and function and for characterizing landscape-scale patterns of wetland occurrence. We monitored water levels in 45 wetlands for three years to characterize the hydrology of wetlands in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon, USA and classified wetlands by hydrogeomorphic (HGM) class to determine whether hydrologic regimes differed in wetlands in different HGM classes. We also compared hydrologic regimes in naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) and mitigation wetlands (MWs) and in wetlands with/without a human-made water-retention structure to determine whether and how human modifications are changing the hydrology of wetlands. We found no relationship between hydrologic attributes and land use, soil association, or wetland area. We did find significant differences related to presence of a water-retention structure and to wetland type (NOW or MW). Water levels were higher and had less temporal variability and more extensive inundation (as % wetland area) in MWs and in wetlands modified to include a retention structure. HGM class was very effective for characterizing wetland hydrology, with significant differences among HGM classes for water level and for extent and duration of inundation. For three regional classes, we found the lowest water levels and lowest extent/duration of inundation in slope wetlands, intermediate conditions in riverine wetlands, and the highest water levels and greatest extent and duration of inundation in depressions. In "atypical" classes (Gwin et al. 1999), average water level and extent of inundation were similar to conditions in depressions, but the within-site variability in water levels in depressions-in-slope-setting and in-stream-depressions was significantly smaller than in the regional classes (p less than or equal to 0.001). Results highlight the importance of both geomorphic setting and wetland structure in defining wetland hydrology and support the use of HGM for wetland classification. Because hydrology is an important determinant of many wetland functions, resource managers using restoration and mitigation to offset wetland losses should strive for project design and siting that re-establish the hydrogeomorphology of natural wetlands to improve the likelihood of replacing wetland functions.

AB We measured soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations in a large sample (n = 95) of freshwater emergent and open water wetlands in the Portland, Oregon, USA, area as part of a study of the ecological development of mitigation wetlands. Mean SOM concentrations were higher in naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) than in mitigation wetlands (MWs) at 0-5 cm (SOM = 9.75 and 5.83%, respectively, p = 0.0001) and at 15-20 cm (SOM = 6.85, 4.68%, p = 0.0551). If temporal accumulation of SOM is occurring, it is slow; we found no significant relationship between SOM and wetland age (p = 0.6003) and no significant change in SOM concentration in soils in MWs sampled in 1987 and 1993. Concentrations of SOM were not significantly related to land use but were related to soil series, texture class, and association, and to hydrogeomorphic class. For a subset of wetlands monitored for hydrology, we also found a significant negative relationship between SOM and the extent of inundation by standing water. Mitigation may be leading to direct loss of SOM, probably resulting from soil management practices during project construction. We also show that hydrologic regime significantly affects SOM. Because most projects in our study were built in pre-existing wetlands and have extensive areas of open water, our results suggest that low concentrations of SOM are likely to persist. For SOM and probably for SOM-supported wetland functions, fundamental goals of mitigation and wetland management (in-kind wetland replacement, no-net-loss of structure and function) are not being achieved, at least in the short term. The success of mitigation, in terms of SOM, could be improved by better project design and better management of soils during project construction.

AB We evaluated the Aoristic condition of freshwater palustrine wetlands dominated by wet meadow, emergent marsh, aquatic vegetation, or open water within the rapidly urbanizing area of Portland, Oregon, USA by (1) characterizing plant species richness (presence/absence) and composition of naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) and mitigation wetlands (MWs) and (2) identifying relationships between floristic characteristics and variables describing land-use, site conditions, and mitigation activities. Data were collected on 45 NOWs and 51 MWs. Overall species richness was high (365 plant taxa), but more than 50% of the species present on both NOWs and MWs were introduced. Only 14 species occurred on more than half the sites, and nine of them were invasive introduced species. The mean number of native species per site did not differ between land-use categories (ANOVA, F = 0.62 at 3 and 88 df, p = 0.6031); however, wetlands surrounded by agricultural and commercial/industrial/transportation corridor uses had more introduced species per site than wetlands surrounded by undeveloped land (Fishers Protected LSD at 88 df, p less than or equal to 0.05). Although overlapping in floristic composition, NOWs and MWs had significantly different (MRPP, p < 0.0001) species assemblages that were identified using TWINSPAN. MRPP analyses for all sites showed that watershed, land-use, HGM class, percent cover of water, and MW age were significantly related to the floristic composition of the study wetlands. Canonical correspondence analyses further revealed that the primary gradient for species distribution in NOWs was related to moisture; the secondary gradient was related to land-use. The primary gradient also described a strong relationship between percent cover of water and HGM class. For MWs, the primary gradient was related to watershed location and surrounding landuse; the secondary gradient was related to percent cover of water and MW age. Most MWs (44 out or 51 sites) were depressions in various settings, so while HGM class separates NOWs from MWs, it does little to distinguish MW assemblages. Our results show that wetlands in the urbanizing study area are floristically degraded. Further, current wetland management practices are replacing natural marsh and wet meadow systems with ponds, resulting in changes in the composition of plant species assemblages.

AB We evaluated effects of rooting by feral hogs (Sus scrofa) on total emergent vegetation cover, vegetation species richness, and diversity of plant-defined microhabitat types in an impounded floodplain marsh in central Florida. Data were collected in 6 split-plots (rooted and control) over 10 post-rooting, monthly sampling periods. Hog rooting led to reduced plant cover in broadleaf marsh habitats and to significantly higher microhabitat diversity and species richness. Although feral hogs can have detrimental effects on native biota and community structure, our data suggest that hog rooting is a disturbance that can enhance plant species richness and associated microhabitat diversity in wetland habitats.

   USA

ID MANAGEMENT
AB A two-stage, stratified, systematic sample design was implemented in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA, to quantify wetland and land-use changes from the 1980s to the 1990s. The Stage I sample (n = 711) was drawn from public land survey sections and was stratified by land use and runoff potential. The Stage IT sample (n = 114) re-sampled the Stage I sample stratified by the amount of hydric soils identified in the Stage I sample. Wetland and upland classes were delineated on large-scale aerial photographs, digitized into ARC/Info coverages, and compared to quantify land-cover changes. Total loss of wetlands to uplands during the study period was about 3,800 ha, representing a 2.1 percent wetland loss from the 1980s. The net loss after adjusting for wetland gains was about 2,750 ha. During the study period, 70 percent of the wetland loss was associated with agriculture, six percent was lost to urbanization, and 24 percent was lost to other changes. The loss of wetlands to agriculture and the conversion of wetland types was consistent with a pronounced climatic component related to below-normal precipitation from 1985 to 1994, although continued installation of tile drains and expansion of irrigated agriculture also may have contributed to the changes. The loss of wetlands to agriculture raised questions regarding the effectiveness of current agricultural wetland policy, which appears ill-prepared to protect small wetlands or to deal with loss of wetlands from intensified use of existing farmland. This study identified a larger number and area of wetlands compared with national wetland surveys because of the larger scale data used in this study, the nature of the strata used in the statistical design, and the inclusion of palustrine farmed wetlands in the landuse classification.

AB We describe the first test conducted to determine user consistency in the application of hydrogeomorphic (HGM) functional assessment models. Over a three-week period, two teams of individuals trained in the HGM methodology assessed 44 riverine wetlands on the Coastal Plain of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, USA. Results demonstrated a high degree of agreement between the two assessment teams for both Variable Subindices and Functional Capacity Index Scores, indicating that the assessment models were robust and results were repeatable. Analyses of the data demonstrated the importance of only using variables whose measurements are repeatable. When variable measurements are not repeatable, HGM functional capacity scores are detrimentally affected, especially functions that are modeled by only a few variables.

AB Beach Pond is a freshwater pond and marsh, located approximately 50-100 m from the beach scarp in the mid-southern portion of St. Catherines Island, Liberty County, Georgia (31 degrees 37'N latitude, 81 degrees 09'W longitude). A 4.5-m sediment core was obtained from the pond in an effort to reconstruct the paleoecology of the site. The sediments (sand, clay, and peat) are Holocene age (<10,000 years). Gross sedimentological characteristics of the core suggest cyclic depositional trends. The modern vegetation of Beach Pond is dominated by Pluchea and other composites, Typha, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae. The palynology of the core reveals dynamic changes in depositional environments and plant communities during sediment accumulation. Sediments from the lower portion of the core were derived from nearshore marine environments and probably represent accumulation in a shallow lagoon; these are characterized by the abundant pollen of Pinus and a large percentage of broken Pinus pollen grains. A piece of wood recovered from the uppermost lagoonal sediments yielded a radiocarbon date (AMS) of 1210 +/- 40 BP. These sediments are overlain by tidal-flat-derived sediments, which are overlain by a thin peat layer derived from an interdunal swale community dominated by Myrica. A return to brackish marsh conditions then occurred, as indicated by the presence of Limonium, Cheno-Am type (e.g., Salicornia), and abundant Poaceae pollen. The modern freshwater pond plant community became established as the salinity decreased; this is indicated by the abundance of freshwater plant taxa (i.e., Azolla, Typha, Cyperaceae). Sea-level fluctuation, erosion, storm overwash, and anthropogenic factors (i.e., road building, water-well drilling) have all influenced the development of past and modern plant communities by altering the hydrology and salinity of the site.

AB We evaluated the influence of intensive agriculture on invertebrate communities of temporary wetlands as indicated by aquatic invertebrate resting eggs, shells, and cases remaining after wetlands dried. To facilitate the comparison, we sampled 19 wetlands within cropland areas and 19 wetlands within grassland areas. We found resting eggs, shells, and cases of significantly more taxa and greater numbers of cladoceran resting eggs (ephippia), planorbid and physid snail shells, and ostracod shells in wetlands within grasslands than in croplands. We also successfully incubated greater numbers of cladocerans and ostracods from soil samples collected from grassland sites. We were unable to detect differences in the viability of cladoceran ephippia between grassland and cropland wetlands, but our sample size was small due to an absence of ephippia in most cropland wetlands sampled; 74% of the cropland wetlands were devoid of cladoceran ephippia whereas ephippia were well represented in nearly all of our grassland sites. Our results corroborate findings of other investigators that prairie pothole wetlands have been negatively impacted by human activities. Our study demonstrates that aquatic invertebrates of temporary wetlands have been negatively impacted by intensive agriculture and suggests that future studies need to assess the influence of agricultural practices on wetland-dependant wildlife.

AB In the absence of wildfire, emergent wetlands in the American Midwest often succeed to a shrub/scrub wetland type. Management activities, including shearing and burning are typically used to remove shrub, resulting in a more open emergent wetland condition. We surveyed breeding birds in managed and unmanaged shrub/scrub wetlands in northeast Minnesota, USA, in 1996 and 1997 to examine breeding bird response to management type (burning and shearing) and time elapsed since management. In a comparison of 58 managed sites and 58 unmanaged sites in 1996, unmanaged sites had more (P < 0.05) species and individuals than managed sites. In addition, 12 of 20 individual species tested differed significantly (P < 0.05) in abundance between the groups. Species associated with emergent wetland type, like the Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and LeConte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) were more abundant (P < 0.05) in managed sites, and species that require shrubs, such as the Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) and Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) were more abundant (P < 0.05) in unmanaged sites. Examination of the effects of management type on breeding birds by either burning, shearing, or both treatments on sites surveyed in 1997 revealed results similar to comparisons of managed and unmanaged sites completed in 1996. In addition, breeding bird composition was not different on sites that varied in time elapsed since management. In these latter comparisons, breeding bird species and community composition were similar among all managed sites but differed from the unmanaged sites.

AB Marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain provide important winter habitats for many species of birds. Many of these marshes are managed intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and 1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species. Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine winter cover) be maintained.

AB Certain soil morphological characteristics create significant problems for hydric soil identification due to lack of commonly observable Fe-based redoximorphic features that indicate seasonally saturated and reduced conditions. Examples include soils with high levels of organic C and red soils (7.5YR or redder) containing high amounts of hematite iron. The objectives of this research were to examine the effects of organic C content and Fe mineralogy on (i) soil redox response and (ii) the development of Fe-based redoximorphic features. Redox reactions related to the fundamental biochemical processes that occur in saturated soils were studied in a controlled laboratory experiment. The experimental design included six columns of red soils (5YR) from northeastern Minnesota and six columns of brown soils (10YR), possessing varying organic carbon contents, from southeastern Minnesota. Redox measurements taken throughout the experiment suggest different soil redox environments between the brown and red soils. The brown soils had redox potentials that decreased gradually and then remained at a constant decreased state around 0.0 mV. Redox potentials for the red soils decreased rapidly and equilibrated in the range of 100 to 300 mV. Variations between these soil responses may be due to different Fe-oxide mineralogies and/or the amount of bioavailable organic carbon.

AB A marsh subject to "structural marsh management," which changes natural wetland hydrology, was found to be functionally impaired when compared to an adjacent unimpounded reference marsh. The "managed" marsh had much lower sedimentation rates and tidal amplitude. Also, net annual primary production was lower in the managed marsh relative to the reference marsh. In light of the great importance of sedimentation, as well as primary production, to vertical accretion and maintenance of the salt marsh surface, our findings support the contention that structural marsh management (SMM) inhibits marsh surface accretion. Even so, much of the Louisiana coast has been proposed for this form of management in an effort to protect it from loss. However, our results show such management activities in the salt marsh could likely increase sediment aggradation deficits and wetland loss, especially in areas subject to high rates of subsidence or sea-level rise, such as Louisiana. Further research is needed to evaluate whether the results shown here are typical for saline SMM sites. In the absence of such research, the use of SMM in salt marshes is not presently recommended.

AB The abundance and distribution of lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) may be influenced by the availability of amphipod crustaceans, since these invertebrates represent an important food source, particularly for immature birds. Another important factor may be degradation of habitat, since scaup nest in wetland margins and adjacent upland habitats. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative importance of amphipods, wetland features such as area and water depth, and indices of margin/upland habitat, on the distribution and abundance of scaup. A subsample of 108 oligosaline wetlands was chosen on twelve sites located in three eco-regions of southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Data were gathered during 1995 on relative amphipod abundance, wetland area, fall water depth, upland nesting habitat type, wetland margin impacts, and spring numbers of lesser scaup. Scaup use of wetlands was significantly affected by the availability of amphipods, wetland margin impacts, and wetland area. Controlling for the effect of area showed that scaup were most common on ponds with abundant amphipods and minimal margin impacts. In the southernmost mixed grassland eco-region, scaup were affected by amphipod availability only, whereas in the moist mixed grassland and parkland eco-regions, results indicated that both margin impact and amphipod availability were significant factors. Results are consistent with hypotheses that decreases in scaup numbers since the mid-1980s may be due to (1) loss, resulting from both human and climatic factors, of natural wetlands capable of supporting rich amphipod populations and (2) continuing agricultural encroachment on remaining wetlands.

AB The number of tree species, or alpha diversity, in terrestrial forests decreases with increasing latitude. However, it is not known whether forests in flooded areas follow the same diversity patterns as upland forests. A good reason for doubt is the evidence that herbaceous wetland plants are most diverse at temperate latitudes. Wetlands are subject to strong environmental constraints, such as flooding, peat (acidity), cold, and salinity, which may be particularly limiting to tree growth and richness. We sampled 12 plots and collected published data from 245 plots of forested wetland around the world. The data were sorted into five categories based upon environmental constraints: tropical freshwater, temperate freshwater, temperate peat, tropical saline, and temperate saline. There was a significant difference in tree richness among the five categories (One-way ANOVA p<0.0001), from a mean of 31 species in tropical freshwater floodplains to 2 in temperate saline wetlands. Generally, tree richness increased with decreasing latitude, but the regression only accounted for 1.6% of the variation. It seems that species richness within forested wetlands is controlled by the cumulative number of environmental constraints.

AB We sampled populations of insects in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota, USA, to determine whether relationships existed between community- or taxon-level indicators and 11 land-use types. Our goal was to determine if agricultural impacts were reflected in measurable differences for insect indicators: abundance, taxa richness, and diversity. Insects were sampled with light traps at 126 wetland basins in three ecoregions. Sampling was conducted three times each year during the spring and early summer of 1995 and 1996. Sites were selected based on the proportion of cropland to grassland, hayland, and Conservation Reserve Program land surrounding wetland basins at 50 and 400 m radii. Other landuse types included in our analyses were woodland, roadways, and five wetland types: permanent, semipermanent, seasonal, temporary, and riverine. In both years, tars richness, abundance, and diversity were greater for the second (June) and third (July) sampling periods than for the first period (May), and indicators were greater in the Drift Plain and Red River Valley ecoregions than in the Missouri Coteau ecoregion. Our analyses indicated several significant associations between insect indicators and land-use types; however, r(2) values were generally low. Much more of the variance in insect measures was explained by temperature, seasonal, and ecoregion effects. Several associations were significant within individual ecoregions (i.e., abundance of aquatic insects, Caenidae, Scarabaeidae, and Lepidoptera and number of Ephemeroptera families). However, no indicators were found in common for all three ecoregions. Several significant associations with land use were identified across all sites (i.e., all ecoregions combined). A small number of the significant relationships found across all sites were related to agricultural land use, and several indicated a negative relationship with grasslands. However, we observed several positive relationships between our insect indicators and riverine wetlands across sites and in the Red River Valley ecoregion for both years and spatial scales (i.e., the abundance of Caenidae, Scarabaeidae, Ceratopogonidae, Hydropsychidae, and Hydroptilidae).

AB Fens occur in many Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds that have historically been affected by metal mining activities. A persistent effect of mining is acid rack drainage (ARD), which flows from mine adits and tailings piles. ARD water has low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals and can pollute surface and ground waters supporting fens. There are few floristic differences between polluted and pristine fens, and it is unclear what long-term affects ARD has on fens. We investigated decomposition of native leaf litter and a standard litter for two years in four Carer aquatilis-dominated subalpine fens. Two of the fens are affected by ARD, and their source waters have pH < 4.0 and high concentrations of dissolved Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb. The other two fens are relatively pristine, with source water pH > 6.0 and low metal concentrations. ARD significantly reduced native litter decomposition rates over two years (ANOVA, p < 0.01), with 63% of the initial mass of leaf litter remaining at the most polluted site (Peru Creek fen), 47% at a moderately polluted site (Argentine fen), and 23% at the most pristine site (Deer Creek fen). ARD also reduced the quality of litter produced. Standard litter decomposed more rapidly than native litter at all sites, particularly Peru Creek fen. Site, representing fen environment, and litter origin, representing native vs, standard litter, significantly affected decomposition rates (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Pristine fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal rich fens, while polluted fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal poor fens and bogs. Acid rock drainage causes ecosystem-level responses in organic matter processing, peat accumulation rates, and most likely in nutrient cycling, which could have long-term affects on fen primary and secondary production and other functions.

AB In the past 100 years, the hydrology and nutrient levels of the Florida Everglades, USA, have been drastically altered by a system of canals and dikes and urban and agricultural development. Levels of soil total phosphorus (TP) have become elevated in the northern part of Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A). Vegetation community changes in the past 20 years in this impacted area are characterized by the invasion of Typha domingensis into historically Cladium jamaicense marshes and aquatic slough communities. The objective of this study was to calibrate modern pollen assemblage data from surface soil samples with soil nutrient data and observed macrophyte changes across a TP gradient at 31 sites in WCA-2A. Soil TP, nitrogen, carbon, biogenic silica, and calcium analyses of soils were included in the study. Modern pollen distribution corresponds to living macrophyte community variation along a TP gradient in WCA-2A. Pollen assemblages associated with three major marsh types in WCA-2A (Typha-dominated, Cladium-dominated, mixed Typha-Cladium) can be defined. Multivariate statistics show that the parameters measured explain about half of the variance in pollen data. TP was the only parameter measured that explains a significant amount of the variation. The remaining chemical variables tested were not significant. Clearly, other environmental factors not measured for this study also affect distributions. Although not analyzed statistically, hydrology patterns in WCA-2A. probably play an important role based on pollen cluster analysis. A weighted averaging (WA) regression model for TP from the pollen assemblages has a high correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.76) between observed and inferred values. This model can be used to estimate present plant community structure based on soil TP content in WCA-2A (e.g., optimal TP levels for specific taxa) and past TP levels based on pollen assemblages found in dated soil core subsamples. Moreover, historical plant community assemblages can be reconstructed from pollen profiles. Such reconstructions are essential to the restoration of the Everglades.

AB The Everglades Nutrient Removal (ENR) Project was constructed to reduce nutrient concentrations in stormwater runoff water from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although nutrient concentrations of influent water ranged from 66 to 201 mu g TP L(-1) and 140 to 541 pg TN L(-1) and varied substantially over time, the outlet concentrations remained low, 9 to 39 mu g TP L(-1) and 99 to 286 mu g TN L(-1), during the first three years of operation (from August 1994 through August 1997). Nutrient removal efficiency was calculated in terms of decrease in both loads and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient loading rates averaged 1.17 g TP m(-2) year(-1) (+/-0.12 SE) and 31.56 g TN m(-2) year(-1) (+/-2.92 SE) at the inflow and 0.23 g TP m(-2) year(-1) (+/-0.02 SE) and 20.71 g TN m(-2) year-' (+/-1.63 SE) at the outflow. TP load removal ranged from 66% to 91% and averaged 82% for the period of record, while TN load removal ranged from 11% to 76% and averaged 55%. Rainfall contribution to the ENR Project nutrient budgets was small, averaging only 4% and 3% for TP and TN, respectively. The ENR Project performance results during the first three years suggest that additional Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) will be effective in removing TP from stormwater runoff.

AB Laubhan and Fredrickson (1992) describe a regression-based method for predicting seed yield of moist-soil plants from measurements of inflorescence morphology and provide predictive equations for 11 species. Using methods similar to Laubhan and Fredrickson (1992), we developed predictive equations for seed production of six additional herbaceous wetland species. Five of our six equations had precision greater or equal to those of Laubhan and Fredrickson (1992). Thus, applying the two sets of available regression equations simultaneously should not produce biased seed-yield estimates. We evaluated the effect of assessing seed production with both sets of equations using a data set collected at Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, USA. Addition of seed-production estimates for the 6 species we describe resulted in a 12% higher total seed production, suggesting that the originally published method may underestimate total seed yield for some plant communities. We encourage other investigators to develop and publish similar regression models to enhance the utility of this method across habitats and regions.

AB Production-to-decomposition quotients and asymptotic limits of peat accumulation were determined to estimate peat and carbon accumulation potentials along a bog-fen-marsh wetland gradient in southern boreal Alberta. The wetlands were a bog, a poor fen (PF), a. wooded moderate-rich fen (WRF), a lacustrine sedge fen (LSF), a riverine sedge fen (RSF), a riverine marsh (RM), and a lacustrine marsh (LM). First year mass losses increased along this gradient (bog 14%, fens 25-61%, marshes 57-62%), with second year total mass losses increasing from 18 to 38% from the bog to the moderate-rich fens. Ratios of aboveground net primary production to decomposition and asymptotic limits of peat accumulation showed decreasing trends from the bog to the fens to the marshes as decay rates increased along the same gradient. The Sphagnum-dominated sites (bog, PF) showed greater pea accumulation potentials than the brown moss-dominated sites (WRF, LSF) and those sites with an insignificant-to-no moss stratum (RSF, RM, LM), which is paralleled by their decreasing peat thicknesses. Rates of litter accumulation in the first year averaged 170 g m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum-dominated sites, 130 g m(-2) yr(-1) in brown moss-dominated sites, and 103 g m(-2) yr(-1) in sites with an insignificant-to-no moss stratum. All three wetland types showed similar carbon accumulation potentials (83, 67, and 50 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) after the first year of decomposition. Peat depth, asymptotic limits of peat accumulation, and production-to-decomposition ratios correlated negatively with water levels, pH, and Ca2+, and they correlated positively with moss and woody plant production (shrubs, trees). Peatlands with strong moss and shrub/tree strata (bog, PF, WRF) accumulate more peat than those wetlands dominated by graminoids (LSF, RSF RM, LM). In the bog, high peat accumulation potentials may be related to low rates of decomposition. The peat accumulation potentials of some fens (PF, WRF) are similar to the bog and may be maintained by higher decomposition rates, which are offset by higher litter inputs. In the graminoid-dominated fens and marshes, peat accumulation potentials are lowest and may be related to higher litter quality, resulting in higher decomposition rates.

AB This study investigated phosphorus (P) concentrations in Donana seasonal wetlands in southwestern Spain as the wetlands started to fill. following storm events after a drought. Both soluble and particulate P flowed into the Donana wetlands through runoff. A gradient in the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations was found from the littoral to the pond center following a 108.5-mm storm. The SRP concentration was 100 times higher 2 m from the shoreline than it was at the pond center. Neither the incoming. SRP nor the total P concentrations were related to the magnitude of storm events. They were always highest during the initial filling periods (first tyoweeks) and lower after subsequent, even heavier storms (>100 mm) a month later. Deposited sediments were a net P sink during the initial filling period of ponds. Samples of fresh vegetation, soil, and manure from a wetland watershed were washed in distilled water for 19 h, and the SRP in the leachates was measured in the laboratory. The highest SRP concentration (1.5 mg gDW(-1)) was leached from the fine (0.1 mm), organic-matter-rich (25% OM) soil diffraction from uplands. The SRP concentration found in pasture soil was 1.3 rag gDW(-1), followed by fresh scrub (1.25 mg gDW(-1)), and manure (0.9 mg gDW(-1)). Only during periods of heavy rainfall does runoff drain from the uplands to the basin of the wetland watersheds. Therefore, we conclude that incoming P concentrations to Donana wetlands vary greatly from year to year according to changes in hydro-meteorological conditions.

AB Malibu Lagoon, California, USA, is a small estuary that has been substantially altered by habitat loss and increased freshwater input from development in its watershed. The lagoon's fish assemblage was sampled at nine stations on 32 occasions between July 1993 and August 1994 on at least a monthly basis using beach seines and fish traps. Thirteen fish species represented by 16,444 individuals were collected. California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis) was by far the most abundant species, comprising 80% of the total catch. Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) constituted 9% of the catch, and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) constituted 7%. As with other temperate estuarine fish assemblages, species richness and abundance varied seasonally, with peaks during summer. The majority of fish collected were juveniles, with topsmelt and California killifish recruitment being extremely high during some periods. Fish use of the portion of the lagoon restored as a salt marsh ten years prior to our study was evaluated. Fish species richness, density, and composition in the restored salt marsh were quite similar to those in the main lagoon as well as other natural salt marshes in southern California. Malibu Lagoon's species richness is low relative to some other southern California wetland systems, particularly large estuaries with uninterrupted tidal flushing, but is comparable to other southern California estuaries with similar hydrology. Despite extensive anthropogenic modification, Malibu Lagoon provides suitable habitat for a variety of fish species.

AB This study examined effects of two sediment textures applied in two loading rates on seedling recruitment from the seed bank in a wetland. Total seedling density (TSD) of an unsedimented, control treatment was 6.8-fold higher than the average density in sedimented treatments (2,085+/-971 seedlings m(-1) versus 305+/-80 seedlings m(-2)). Consequently, biomass in the control, was significantly greater than biomass among sedimented treatments (84.4+/-29.5 gm m(-2) versus 24.6+/-8.9 gm m(-2)). Large sediment loads also significantly decreased TSD compared to low sediment loads (192+/-72 seedlings m(-2) versus 417+/-87 seedlings m(-2)). Sediment texture did not significantly alter seedling density, but TSD was markedly suppressed by coarse-texture sediment relative to fine-texture sediment (258+/-67 seedlings m(-2) versus 351+/-92 seedlings m(-2)). In addition, seedling density was significantly and positively correlated with seed mass in the coarse-textured treatments and in the low-loading treatments. The response to sedimentation by individual plant taxa was not consistent and presumably varied as a function of life-history characteristics. Species richness and diversity were significantly greater under the low loading treatment than the high loading treatment.

ID MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL DORMANCY
AB Seeds (mericarps) of Ptilimnium nuttallii have linear, underdeveloped embryos that must grow from about 0.2 to 1.3 mm in length before the radicle emerges from the seed (fruit); thus, seeds have morphological dormancy (MD). in addition to MD, about 70% of the seeds also have physiological dormancy (PD) at maturity in mid-July; thus, seeds have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). Whereas fresh seeds with only MD (26-29%) germinated in light during 2 weeks of incubation at 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15 degrees C, those with MPD required exposure to high temperatures (25/15, 30/15 degrees C), which broke PD, before they would germinate. The high temperature requirement for loss of PD means that seeds have nondeep simple MPD. Seeds buried in soil in July 1991 and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes came out of PD during the summers of 1991-1996, and those failing to germinate in autumn of each year re-entered PD during winter. Thus, seeds have an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle with respect to PD, and MD can be broken only while seeds are not physiologically dormant. Light was required for embryo growth in 55-98% of the seeds, but the light requirement varied with year. Consequently, embryo growth and germination are restricted to autumn, and seeds on the soil surface are more likely to germinate than those buried in soil. Results of this study indicate that P. nuttallii is a strict winter annual with a long-term soil seed bank. The annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle would prevent germination in spring when high water levels in the habitat might be inhibitory for successful seedling establishment.

AB Bogs and fens are rare communities in the southern Appalachians of the USA. Many have been degraded, and little ecological information beyond cursory floral inventories is available to help guide conservation and restoration efforts. The seedling emergence technique was used to examine the soil seed banks of open and closed canopy regions of a southern mountain fen in North Carolina. We also examined the seed bank of an adjoining portion of the floodplain, which had been drained and cleared for a golf fairway and is now slated for restoration. A total of 32 taxa emerged, with graminoids (particularly Juncus spp.) dominating all three seed banks. Seedlings were assigned to one of five plant types: woody, rush, sedge, grass, or forb. Significantly more woody seedlings emerged in soils from the closed canopy fen than in soils from the other two areas. Most rush seedlings emerged in open canopy fen soils, more sedge and forb seedlings emerged in floodplain soils, and more grass seedlings emerged in floodplain soils than in closed canopy fen soils. A discriminant function analysis separated the open canopy fen from the closed canopy fen and floodplain by seedlings of woody plants and rushes. The floodplain was separated from the open and closed regions of the fen by sedge and grass seedlings. These patterns in seed bank composition bore little similarity to the standing vegetation in the three areas. Restoration activities planned for the floodplain are intended to restore its hydrology and microtopography, which will strongly influence recruitment from the seed bank and surrounding seed sources.

AB Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic whitecedar) swamps are in decline in the New Jersey Pinelands, while Acer rubrum (red maple) swamps are increasing. One possible reason for this occurrence may be differences in seedling recruitment of the two species. Seedling establishment of different species is expected to vary with physical conditions and requirements for safe sites. This study examined differences in seedling recruitment for C. thyoides and A. rubrum in the New Jersey Pinelands. A field survey of six C. thyoides swamps found that C. thyoides seedlings occur most often under an open or C. thyoides canopy on peaty, cedar needle covered soils or on mats of Sphagnum. In contrast, A. rubrum seedlings were most often found under A. rubrum canopies on Sphagnum mats or grass-dominated bottom areas. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine whether differences in microhabitat occupation were related to differences in growth of C. thyoides and A. rubrum seedlings. Seedlings were grown in different soil types (Sphagnum or peat) and at different water levels (inundated, saturated, or moist soil) typical of those found in C. thyoides swamps within the New Jersey Pinelands. Chamaecyparis thyoides experienced the greatest increase in height in moist soils and the least increase in height in inundated soils. Chamaecyparis thyoides achieved greater biomass than A. rubrum in peat soil, while A. rubrum had greater biomass in Sphagnum. These results indicate that C. thyoides and A. rubrum differ in conditions that are best for their seedling growth and that different management schemes may favor one species over the other.

AB Wetland classification and management often requires. information on the contribution of ground water to a wetland's water budget. Direct estimation of this parameter, however, is time-consuming, expensive; and can typically only be accomplished for small areas. Thus, a method to characterize ground-water flow in wetland areas and regions may be useful in marry applications. The estimation technique described combines the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) with transient numerical modeling and assumes that the water table reflects the general pattern of surface topography. The DEM grid elevations are used as initial heads in the model. Stepwise ground-water drainage from the flow domain is simulated until a reasonable match is obtained between the observed and model water tables. By knowing or assuming hydraulic conductivity and using the model water-table configuration, an estimate for ground-water flow to and from each discretized grid node can be estimated from Darcy's Law and the Dupuit approximation. The net result, when mapped, shows the simulated distribution of recharge and discharge within and surrounding the wetland. Two examples from the Shingobee River headwaters in central Minnesota indicate how the method may be used. Geologically recent development of glacial landforms has led to numerous lakes, ponds, and wetlands in the region. Using a 30-m, 1:24,000 scale DEM grid in combination with data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory, the model predicts the most likely areas of ground-water interaction in and near wetlands and lakes. More quantitative results can be obtained by applying observed water budget and soil/aquifer parameter data.

   nitrogen budget; sediment
ID WATER
AB From December 1993 through November 1994, we conducted a nitrogen mass-balance study on a 0.74-ha, surface-flow wetland that receives water from an oxidation pond in the municipal wastewater treatment system in Arcata, California, USA. Water samples were collected biweekly and analyzed for concentrations of NO(3)-N (nitrate), NH(4)-N (total ammonia), and TN (total nitrogen). Flow was calculated from hydraulic head measurements taken at two inlet weirs. Macrophytes and sediment were sampled during summer to estimate N storage in these compartments. The wetland removed 17% of the 16,600 kg of influent N during the annual cycle. Little removal occurred prior to mid-May; whereas from mid-May through November, 37% of influent N was removed. Expressed on an areal basis, net N removal was 1.84 g N . m(-2). d(-1) during the warmer months of the year and 1.07 g N . m(-2). d(-1) during the entire 12-month period. Nitrogen storage in the seasonal, above-ground increment of macrophyte biomass was only 7% of overall N removal by the marsh. From 1986 to 1994, 990-2,390 kg of N (or 0.046-0.11 g N . m(-2). d(-1)) accumulated in the sediment-only 4-10% of overall annual N removal. Mean annual TN removal (1.07 g N . m(-1). d(-1)) considerably exceeded mean influent NO(3)-N loading (0.64 g N . m(-1). d(-1)), and removal of TN was highly correlated with NO(3)-N mass loading (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). Thus, sequential nitrification/denitrification appears to occur in the marsh, and denitrification (estimated at 0.95-1.02 g N . m(-2). d(-1)) appears to be the primary N-removal mechanism.

AB Prior to 1961, the water levels of Lake Manitoba and the adjacent Delta Marsh fluctuated synchronously with a range of more than 2.2 m. Since 1961, the water level of Lake Manitoba has been regulated to fluctuate less than 0.6 m. Aerial photographs were used to quantify changes between the pre- and post-regulation distribution of Typha species, Phragmites australis, and Scolochloa festucacea along elevation gradients in the marsh. Pre-regulation shorelines were dominated by Phragmites. After regulation, Typha expanded up the elevation gradient, encroaching on Phragmites, and expanded down the gradient, invading shallow water. This study suggests that with continued stable water levels Typha will expand further along the elevation gradient leading to the eventual in-filling of the Delta Marsh.

AB Insects of Great Lakes coastal wetlands have received Little attention in spire of their importance in food webs and sensitivity to anthropogenic stressors. We characterized insect communities from four coastal wetlands that spanned the length of a trophic gradient in Green Bay during spring and summer of 1995. We sampled flying insects using sticky traps in dense emergent, sparse emergent, and open water-submergent vegetation zones within each wetland and estimated numerical abundance, biomass (mg dry weight) and taxonomic composition. We found that insect abundance and biomass were distributed differently among vegetation zones within wetlands along the gradient during both spring and summer. insect abundance was highest at oligotrophic Portage Marsh during spring and lowest in wetlands toward the lower (southern), eutrophic end of the bay. Biomass did not differ consistently along the trophic gradient but increased with increasing emergent vegetation cover in 3 of 4 wetlands during both seasons. Ordination revealed distinct gradients in community structure on both regional (i.e., upper, middle, and lower Green Bay) and local (vegetation zones within wetlands) scales. Wetlands sorted in order of trophic status during both seasons, primarily due to abundant small Chironomidae, such as trophic-sensitive Heterotrissocladius changi, in middle and upper bay wetlands. Chironomidae also were a dominant component of open water-submergent assemblages in all wetlands. Lower bay wetlands were characterized by fewer but larger Chironomidae (e.g., Chironomus spp.), as well as Ceratopogonidae, Calliphoridae, and Ephydridae, which were most abundant in stands of emergent vegetation. Our results suggest that eutrophy in the lower bay may contribute to relatively poor foraging conditions for insectivorous fish and young waterfowl during spring, and they demonstrate the utility of using insect communities to assess environmental degradation, such as excessive nutrient loading, in coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes.

AB Components of the surface energy balance were measured using the Bowen ratio-energy balance method in three different communities (Phragmites australis, Scirpus acutus, and open water) in a wetland located in north-central Nebraska during the growing season of 1994. During daytime, the heat storage term (S) was a considerably larger sink of energy in open water as compared to the vegetated communities (Phragmites and Scirpus). During nighttime, S was a significant source of energy in all three communities. As compared to the evapotranspiration (ET) from Phragmites and Scirpus, the evaporation (E) from open water (averaged over the measurement period) was about 25% smaller during daytime and three times larger during the night. The diurnal pattern of ET in Phragmites and Scirpus generally followed that of R-n The diurnal pattern of the open water E, however., did not follow R-n; rather, it seemed to depend on thermal stability conditions and air dryness. For the overall measurement period, the daily integrated (24-hour) evaporation from the open water area was 8% more than the evapotranspiration from the Phragmites-dominated part of the wetland and 17% more than the evapotranspiration from the Scirpus-dominated part of the wetland.

ID MITIGATION; LAKE
AB Although considered the most important component for the establishment and persistence of wetlands, hydrology has been hard to characterize and linkages between hydrology and other environmental conditions are often poorly understood. In this work, methods for characterizing a wetland's hydrology from hydrographs were developed, and the importance of ground water to the physical and geochemical conditions in the root zone was investigated. Detailed sampling of neatly continuous hydrographs showed that sites with greater ground-water discharge had higher water tables and more stable hydrographs. Subsampling of the continuous hydrograph failed to characterize the sites correctly, even though the wetland complex is located in a strong regional ground-water-discharge area. By comparing soil-moisture-potential measurements to the water-table hydrograph at one site, we noted that the amount of root-zone saturation was not necessarily driven by the water-table hydrograph but can be a result of other soil parameters (i.e., soil texture and associated capillary fringe). Ground-water discharge was not a significant determinant of maximum or average temperatures in the root zone. High ground-water discharge was associated with earliest date of thaw and shortest period of time that the root zone was frozen, however. Finally, the direction and magnitude of shallow ground-water flow was found to affect the migration and importance of a geochemical species. Areas of higher ground-water discharge had less downward penetration of CO2 generated in cheroot zone. In contrast, biotically derived CO2 was able to penetrate the deeper ground-water system in areas of groundwater recharge. Although ground-water flows are difficult to characterize, understanding these components is critical to the success of wetland restoration and creation efforts.

AB Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

AB Major earthquake uplifts in south-central Alaska of marine deltaic surfaces to an inter-tidal or supra-tidal status cause drastic shifts in processes and vegetation. To assess long-term ecosystem changes as a deltaic landscape converted from a tidal marsh to a supra-tidal wetland, we studied a four-stage chronosequence of deltaic surfaces (30-yr-old inter-tidal surface, 352-yr-old inter-tidal surface, 30-yr-old supra-tidal surface, and 280-yr-old supra-tidal surface). Plots were used to gather landform, soils, and vegetation information, and landform schematics and aerial photo interpretation were used to determine their spatial distribution. Succession progressed on inter-tidal surfaces from pioneer species (principally Carer lyngbyaei) on newly uplifted mud flats, to a mature tidal marsh with channels, levees, and basins dominated by Carer lyngbyaei with thick root mats. Uplift of the mature tidal surface to a supra-tidal status allowed freshwater tolerant species (Equisetum fluviatile, Sphagnum spp.) to invade the basins, and trees and shrubs displaced herbaceous vegetation on levees. On the oldest supra-tidal surface, basins developed peatlands (Andromeda polifolia, Sphagnum spp.), and pH decreased. Levees supported trees or shrubs on mineral or peat soils. Vegetation zonation within a basin-levee complex was evident and repeated, with some variation, across the surfaces. At the landscape scale moving inland, gradients in vegetation occurred on all surface ages.

AB We assessed the effect of regional watershed conditions on plant community attributes, seedbed and seedling density, and environmental conditions in New Jersey Pinelands Atlantic white cedar (Chamne-cyparis thyoides) swamps under three disturbance regimes (high, moderate, and low). High regional water shed disturbance, defined by the percentage basin cover of combined residential and agricultural development, was associated with elevated pH, specific conductance, and nutrient concentrations in surface waters adjacent to our study sites. High disturbance sites generally had lower understory species richness and differed from other sites in overall understory species composition. High canopy red maple (Acer rubrum) cover and high canopy closure were also associated with swamps in high disturbance basins. Because other environmental variables did not differ significantly between disturbance types and red maple is a common associate of cedar throughout the Pinelands, differences in species richness and composition may be related to canopy conditions rather than the effects of watershed disturbance. Regional differences in biogeography may also be a factor. We found no exotic species in our study sites. Only one species considered uncharacteristic of the Pinelands was associated with high disturbance basin sites. Unlike previous, similar studies in the Pinelands, the high disturbance sites did not support a unique group of plants. Although Sphagnum cover (typically associated with optimal cedar seedbed conditions) was lowest in disturbed basin sites, there were no significant differences in overall seedbed conditions and cedar seedling density. Cedar swamps located a distance from upgradient watershed disturbances and not affected by overbank flooding seem to be buffered from the impacts of these regional disturbances.

AB Several factors affecting soil structural stability interact in the natural grasslands of the Flooding Pampa (Argentina). This seasonal and hat wetland (usually ponded in winter-spring and dry in summer) has swelling soils, which are affected by seasonal increases in sodium, and continuous grazing by cattle. Our study aimed to determine the period of structural deterioration, the magnitude of deterioration, and the time for recovery in a widely distributed soil of the region. The mean weight diameter of wet-sieved aggregates (MWD) was determined in grazed and ungrazed (exclosure) plots. Aggregate MWD was often lower in the soil under grazing (from 4.4 to 5.1 mm) than in that of the exclosed area (from 4.7 to 5.4 mm). This reduction in aggregate size was attributable to the mechanical shearing action of trampling. Soil water content accounted for 74% of the variation in aggregate MWD under grazing. At low soil water contents, the structure of the grazed soil became less stable. Grazing effects on soil structural stability are significant only in periods when the soil dries. Stocking rates must be regulated at those dry periods.

AB Potential damage to wetlands by land-use practices has prompted a need for relatively inexpensive, reliable indicators in monitoring ecological conditions. In this study, soil classification and the following soil tests, sodium bicarbonate-extractable P, nitrate (NO3-), organic matter (OM), pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and Cs-137 distribution, were used to compare four wetlands surrounded by cultivated land or grassland. Cumulic A horizons greater than 60-cm thick were found covering the wet meadow zone of the wetland surrounded by cultivated land. No cumulic A horizons were observed in wet meadow zones adjacent to grassland. Laboratory analyses of surface (0-15 cm) soil showed that the wetland surrounded by cultivated land had P concentrations 2.5 to 6 times higher in the wet meadow and shallow marsh zones than did the other wetlands. In the wetland surrounded by cultivated land, the dominant soil separate in the wet meadow was silt, while sand was the dominant soil separate in the wet meadow zone in the other three wetlands. Phosphorus, OM, and NO3- concentrations in wet meadow subsoils (15-60 cm) were higher in the wetland surrounded by cultivated land than in the wetlands surrounded by grasslands. Cesium-137 activities were about 3 to 6 times greater in surface (0-15 cm) soils collected from upland grassy slopes compared to cultivated slopes. Soil morphology, Cs-137, P and OM data indicate higher sedimentation and fertilization rates in wetlands next to cultivated fields.

TI Quantifying impacts to riparian wetlands associated with reduced flows
   along the Greybull River, Wyoming
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE Greybull River; HEC-RAS modeling; riparian wetlands; Wyoming
AB Reductions in river flows associated with hydrologic changes from diversions may reduce water elevations and impact hydrology of riparian wetlands. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies currently do not have appropriate tools to evaluate effects of hydrologic changes on wetlands. We describe use of HEC-RAS modeling to predict and quantify wetland impacts along 10 km of the Greybull River, Wyoming, USA following a proposed 28,313 L/sec diversion for a new off-channel reservoir. Riparian wetlands were delineated and mapped on aerial photographs and topographic maps. A water-surface-profile model of the river was developed using the HEC-RAS model. Floodplain boundaries with and without the diversion were plotted to the same scale and overlaid on the wetland maps to estimate area of wetlands that would not be flooded under the reduced flow model. The model predicted that total area hooded under the 28,313 L/sec diversion in the reach analyzed would be reduced from 167.2 to 149.7 ha and that approximately 0.47 ha of wetland would be impacted by the diversion. We believe that the procedure we used is a valid method to quantify effects of diversions on riparian wetlands and that this procedure should be further evaluated as a method to assess wetland impacts on similar projects.

SO WETLANDS

   wetland delineation; wetland hydrology
ID ROOTS
AB Hydric soils are identified on-site using visible features called "field indicators." It is not known how long it takes for these indicators to form nor whether they occur in created wetlands less than 5-years old. This study evaluated chemical and morphological changes in a created wetland to monitor the development of hydric soil field indicators over time. A deep marsh, created in 1989, was studied from 1992 through 1994 at the Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Project near Chicago, Illinois, USA. Soil and water samples were collected twice a year from two transects having plots in the following landscape positions: in the marsh, along the marsh edge, in a transition zone to the upland, and in the upland. Detailed profile descriptions were also completed twice per year. In 1994, the soils were classified from the marsh to upland as Typic Endoaquoll, Mollic Endoaquept, Aquic Hapludalf, and Ochreptic Hapludalf, Soil pH values ranged from 7.3 to 7.8 in the upper 15 cm. Carbonates were closest to the surface in the marsh and edge positions. Organic C levels were similar among soils throughout the study at approximately 20 g C/kg soil. Redox potentials and water-table measurements indicated that soil in the marsh and edge positions met the definition of hydric soils throughout the study, while upland positions did not, and soil in the transition positions met the definition in some years. Hydric soil field indicators formed by Fe reduction developed over time in the marsh and edge plots and in some plots of the transition to the upland. The depleted matrix indicator, which formed by the reduction and removal of Fe from the soil matrix, gave the most consistent results for identifying hydric soils. Full development of the indicator in all edge plots was complete 5 years after the marsh was constructed. Indicators formed by organic matter accumulation (organic bodies) also developed in the marsh within this period.

DE tidal freshwater marsh; vegetation pattern; temporal change; tidal

ID WETLANDS
AB Temporal changes in vegetation patterns of Chesapeake Bay wetlands have been poorly documented. Data from a 1987 vegetation analysis of a Chesapeake Bay tidal freshwater marsh were compared to those of a vegetation study completed in 1974. Changes in the vegetation pattern were calculated using species importance values and a species diversity index. Comparison of the 1987 and 1974 results shows no significant difference in species diversity index. However, there was a significant difference in species contribution to the index. Spartina cynosuroides, an oligohaline species that was not among the dominant species listed in the 1974 study, had the fourth highest importance value in this study. The change in dominant species composition of the marsh may reflect a directional shift from tidal freshwater toward oligohaline conditions.

AB Alnus japonica in Kiritapp Mire, eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan was studied to determine the effects of temperature, precipitation, and sunshine upon radial growth. Alnus japonica grows in wetlands, and the distribution in Kiritapp Mire is at the latitudinal limit of the species. Wood samples (n = 101) were collected from a well-developed A. japonica wetland forest, and standardized tree-ring-width indices were developed using a third-order polynomial equation and high-frequency-pass filter. A significant positive correlation was found between tree-ring-width indices and corresponding annual mean temperatures and between both mean temperature and cumulative sunshine period during the growing season (June-October). Precipitation during the period of generally lowest redox potential (September) showed a significant positive correlation with tree growth. June sunshine of the ring-formation year and August sunshine during the previous growth year also showed significant positive correlations.

AB Water levels, nutrient supplies, and vegetation cover are key issues in the successful management of wetland habitats. The Hilliardton Marsh Provincial Wildlife Area is a newly restored wetland in northeastern Ontario, Canada about 200 ha in size. It is entirely enclosed by a dike. To maintain water levels, water is pumped into Cell 1 from the adjacent Blanche River and is allowed to flow into Cell 2 and other cells in the wetland by water-control devices between the cells. This study explores the effectiveness of environmental isotopes, oxygen-18 (O-18) and deuterium (H-2), in tracing water circulation and mixing of isotopically depleted river water and isotopically enriched wetland water during two pumping events in two of the wetland cells. In Cell 1, water levels rose everywhere as a result of pumping. delta(18)O values at sampling stations closest to the inflow became isotopically depleted by river water almost immediately after the pump was turned on. Despite rising water levels, stations farthest away from the inflow did not show any initial change in the isotopic composition of the water for the duration of the period of this study. Stations in the center of the cell had intermediate isotopic values. The isotope data suggest that river water is only present in the cell portion closest to the inflow. River water and wetland water mix in the central part of the cell, and river water never reaches areas farthest from the inflow. It appears that wetland water is displaced by the pumped river water and is forced by hydrostatic pressure into areas farthest from the inflow. When Cell 1 waters are allowed to flow into Cell 2, there is mixing between river water and wetland waters. This study shows that environmental isotopes can be effective tracers for determining mixing and water-flow patterns in restored wetlands.

ID BIOLOGY
AB Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is a perennial herbaceous plant that was introduced in the 1800s into North America. Its geographical expansion has generated much concern, in part because its spread may lead to a reduction in the diversity of plant species in wetlands. We tested this hypothesis by examining the association between the abundance of Lythrum salicaria and vascular plant species richness in forty-one 2m x 2m plots located along the Bar River, Ontario, Canada. No significant differences in mean species richness were found between plots with and without L. salicaria. For those plots containing L. salicaria, species richness was not related to the percentage cover of L. salicaria. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the number of introduced plant species between plots with and without L. salicaria, nor were there differences with increasing percent cover of L. salicaria. Plant species such as Nuphar variegatum, Scirpus atrovirens, Scirpus cyperinus, and Scirpus microcarpus were more likely to be found in plots with Lythrum salicaria than without. However, no plant species were significantly mon likely to be found in plots without Lythrum salicaria than with it. Collectively, these results provide no support for the hypothesis that the number of species in wetlands is decreasing in association with the invasion of Lythrum salicaria in Ontario.

AB Production and nutrient content of litterfall (LF) and benthic organic standing stocks were measured in three limesink wetlands of southwest Georgia, USA for one year to investigate how structural characteristics of relatively undisturbed cypress-blackgum wetlands influence organic matter inputs and processing. These isolated, non-alluvial wetlands are shallow and seasonally inundated, filling during late winter storms and drying during early summer droughts. Because they receive most of their organic carbon from litterfall, the forest canopy may regulate energy flows and influence biological processing of benthic organic matter (BOM). Forest composition was determined using the point-quarter method. Litterfall and BOM (coarse fraction greater than or equal to 1 mm, CBOM) were collected bi-weekly during fall and winter and monthly during the remainder of the year. Litterfall turnover rates were estimated as k(CPOM) = total LF/mean annual CBOM. The wetlands were dominated by Nyssa biflora (Importance Value (IV) = 43.1, 50.3, 57.1) and Taxodium ascendens (IV=28.2, 27.6, 34.1). Total litterfall ranged from 410 to 582 g m(-2) yr(-1), with peak litterfall occurring in December. Litterfall nitrogen and phosphorus inputs ranged from 4.3 to 5.2 gNm(-2) yr(-1) and 0.22 to 0.27 gPm(-2)yr(-1). Standing stocks of CBOM ranged from 351 to 1842 g ash free dry mass (AFDM) m(-2) over the duration of the study. Forest structural data suggest that these wetlands have among the greatest basal area/stem ratios reported in the Southeastern U.S., with some of the highest rates of litter production reported for non-alluvial swamp forests. Indices of nutrient-use efficiency suggested that these wetlands were very efficient at recycling nutrients. Litterfall turnover rates fell within the range reported for forested wetlands, and turnover times exceeded one year (2.23-2.38yr), suggesting organic matter accumulation within the wetlands.

AB We conducted an herbivore-exclusion plus neighbor-removal experiment to determine whether herbivory and competition had independent or interactive effects on a wetland plant, blue vervain (Verbena hastata). Eight-week-old plants were added to 1.5 m(2) experimental plots with neighboring reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) either left intact or removed and herbivores either not excluded or excluded. Neighbors were removed with herbicide and hand-weeding while herbivores were excluded by surrounding a plant with 6-mm wire mesh and spraying the plant weekly with a systemic insecticide. Treatment effects were determined by monitoring plant survival over two growing seasons and by measuring inflorescence mass in the second season. The two treatments had a synergistic, interactive effect on plant survival (G = 25.7, P < 0.001). Four of the five plants per treatment survived when exposed to herbivory alone or to competition alone, but no plants survived when exposed to both herbivory and competition. The two treatments had a substitutive, interactive effect on inflorescence mass (F = 11.26, P < 0.0005). Mean infloresccnce mass was only 0-1 g plant(-1) when plants were exposed to herbivory alone or to competition alone or to both herbivory and competition. Plants not exposed to either herbivory or competition had a mean inflorescence mass of 60 g plant(-1). Since effects of herbivory and competition were interactive rather than independent, future studies measuring either herbivory or competition effects on wetland plants should include both herbivore-exclusion and neighbor-removal treatments.

AB Habitat characteristics of wetlands that contain the federally endangered sedge, Scirpus ancistrochaetus, were investigated in a one-point-in-time held survey. Sixteen adjacent seasonal ponds, four of which supported populations of S. ancistrochaetus, were sampled for 26 habitat variables. Using only five of these variables, we were able to separate ponds with and without S. ancistrochaetus in a linear discriminant analysis. These five variables are wetland area, percent cover of overlying forest canopy, soil percent organic matter, soil exchangeable [Na], and water [H-]. Ponds containing S. ancistrochaetus had higher soil organic matter content, higher soil [Na], greater area, lower water [H+], and lower percent forest canopy cover compared to ponds that did not support this species. This information can be used toward understanding factors that control the distribution of this species and also toward evaluating possible habitat fur reintroduction of this endangered species.

TI Long-term vegetation change in Louisiana tidal marshes, 1968-1992
SO WETLANDS
LA English

DE vegetation change; Louisiana; tidal marsh
ID LAND LOSS; COASTAL; HERBIVORY; SALINITY; USA
AB The Louisiana coastal marshes form some of the most extensive wetlands within the continental United States. The problem of land loss in these coastal marshes is well-documented but very little is known about possible changes in vegetation composition that might be associated with this loss. We analyzed vegetation data collected from 1968 to 1992 in the tidal wetlands of Terrebonne parish and described five vegetation types that occur in this region. Our data did not show the predicted change to more salt-tolerant vegetation. This is probably due to the influence of the Atchafalaya River in the study area. However, we documented a large change in the dominant vegetation of the fresh marsh. Panicum hemitomon-dominated marshes occupied 51% of the study area in 1968 and only 14% in 1992. This vegetation type was replaced with Eleocharis baldwinii-dominated marshes (3% in 1968 to 41% in 1992). This change occurred adjacent to an area of significant conversion to open water. Based on limited available data from the literature, we evaluated three potential driving factors in this change-grazing, water-level increase, and water quality-but could not determine the cause of change definitively.

TI Sources of recently deposited sediments in playa wetlands
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE erosion; playas; sedimentation; soils; volume loss
ID SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS
AB There are more than 20,000 playa wetlands in the Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico. Playas with cropland watersheds have lost most of their basin volume due to sedimentation, and they have lost more volume than playas with rangeland watersheds. To determine the source (wind vs, water transport) of sedimentation in playas and develop management recommendations to lessen sediment impacts, we examined the particle size distribution (PSD) of soils in 8 playas with rangeland and cropland watersheds. The distribution curves of sand in playa sediments plotted against relative distance coincided with playa elevational profiles, and the PSD of deeper sediments contained more sand, especially at the playa margins. In contrast, more clay had been deposited in the central portion of the playa basin, and clay content decreased with sediment depth. Sand content at playa edges was greater in crop than in range playas. Sediments eroded from the surrounding watershed resulted in deposition of coarser soil particles at the plays margin, whereas finer particles dominated playa centers. Because most sediments in playa wetlands originate from the immediate watershed and an deposited through water erosion, management activities should concentrate on practices that reduce watershed erosion.

AB The hydrology of a created riparian wetland system was characterized for local and regional conditions. Three methods, two laboratory and one in situ, were used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of the wetland substrate. Hydraulic conductivity values and measured vertical gradients were used to estimate seepage loss to ground water. Surface-water inflow and outflow dominated the hydrologic budget for the wetland. Precipitation, seepage loss, and evapotranspiration were minor components of the hydrologic budget. Water seeping from the wetland into the ground-water-flow system has characteristics of a local groundwater-flow system. Ground-water modeling and particle tracking show that water originating from the wetland seeps into the ground water and flows in the local ground-water system to the southeast portion of the site. Ground-water travel times were estimated to range from 700 to 1,200 days before being discharged to the Olentangy River.

AB Dense monocultures of Phragmites australis (common reed) have been rapidly expanding in Connecticut's tidal wetlands at the expense of cordgrass (Spartina spp.) and cattail (Typha spp). Bird and vegetation surveys in 40 salt and brackish marshes showed that there were significantly fewer species of birds and state-listed species in Phragmites-dominated wetlands than in short-grass marshes. Seaside Sparrow, Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrow, and Willet, three marsh specialists adapted to nesting in short graminoids, had low frequencies in plots dominated by Phragmites. Marsh Wren and Swamp Sparrow, however, are marsh specialists that prefer tall, reedy vegetation, and both species had significantly greater densities at sites with more Phragmites or cattail. Although the bird communities of cattail sites and Phragmites sites were similar, the abundance of Virginia Rails was positively correlated with percent cover of cattail but not Phragmites. The extent of pools was positively related to bird species richness in short-grass meadows but not in Phragmites plots. In Phragmites-dominated wetlands, the height and density of reed stands may inhibit bird use of any pools that are present. Muskrats create pools that may enhance bird species richness, but populations of this mammal have dwindled during the same time period that Phragmites increased in Connecticut's marshes. Although a few species may benefit from reed invasion, it has a negative impact on some marsh bird species that have already declined. These findings support the continued need for marsh restoration and the control of common reed.

TI Modeling the effects of nutria (Myocastor coypus) on wetland loss

AB We created a model to study the process in which nutria (Myocastor coypus) feeding activities lead to erosion and loss of marsh area. This model ties together data on nutria population dynamics and feeding behavior from the literature with data from field studies on the phenology of Scirpus americanus and Spartina patens conducted in the Barataria Basin, Louisiana, USA in 1992. The complete model consists of three linked models: a model of nutria population dynamics (nutria model), a model of the annual marsh biomass cycle of Scirpus americanus and Spartina patens (biomass model), and a plant-biomass density-dependent marsh area model (area model). When all three models are linked together, they form the "nutriabiomass-area model." Analysis of the models indicated the following. (1) The high population densities and low survivorship rates as reported in the literature are incompatible. (2) The nutria model is sensitive to adult and juvenile survivorship and, to a lesser extent, young born per female. It is not particularly sensitive to gestation periods, impregnation rates, or time to maturity. (3) The marsh area model is not sensitive to the marsh loss equation nor to the density at which loss of marsh area begins but is sensitive to the amount of biomass destroyed per nutria. (4) Nutria numbers do not significantly decrease in the nutria-biomass-area model until the total marsh area approaches zero because marsh loss occurs only during winter when marsh biomass is at its annual low.

AB Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of eastern North Dakota, USA are often overgrown with cattails (Typha spp), providing habitat for crop-depredating blackbirds and impeding use by waterfowl. One and two years post-treatment (1992 and 1993), we assessed the response of invertebrates to a catastrophic reduction in cattail coverage caused by glyphosate, a herbicide applied to about 14,000 ha of North Dakota's wetlands since 1991. Numbers of Crustacea, Hydracarina, Oligochaeta, Copepoda, Ostracoda, and Cladocera were similar between treated and reference wetlands (P > 0.10), while abundance of Gastropoda was greater in the treated wetlands (P = 0.10). Insect abundance was greater in treated wetlands (P < 0.01), with activity traps yielding highest numbers in July. Corixidae and Chironomidae were more abundant in treated wetlands (P < 0.10), whereas Chaoboridae was consistently more plentiful in the reference wetlands (P = 0.05). Our results suggest that populations of some aquatic invertebrates may be enhanced by a reduction in cattail coverage with glyphosate-based herbicide.

AB A study was conducted to determine the fate of the herbicide metolachlor in a tidal wetland soil located along the James River in Virginia, USA. Soil adsorption/desorption and mineralization characteristics and mobility of metolachlor were determined on the Levy tidal wetland soil. The metolachlor K-d value was 65.8 L kg(-1) and K-oc value was 810 L kg(-1) C-1, which are much greater than would be found on typical agricultural soils. After four 24-h desorption periods, the total amount of metolachlor that desorbed ranged from 16 to 22% of the amount initially adsorbed. Metolachlor mineralization was about 0.46% of the amount applied after 84 days, which indicates that it does not mineralize very readily in the Levy soil. The amount of metolachlor that leached from the soil columns averaged 1.64% of the amount applied after 84 days, showing a low degree of mobility. These results suggest that the Levy tidal wetland soil can function as an effective filter of metolachlor and other similar herbicides that enter via agricultural runoff, protecting surface and ground waters.

AB A 15-month-long hydrogeologic investigation of a fen-wetland complex in northeastern Illinois, USA indicated the encroachment of ground-water-borne anthropogenic contaminants into two of three high quality fens. Ground-water flow directions and chemical evidence indicated that plumes of ground water with anomalously large concentrations of Na+ and Cl- originated from a private septic system and from rock salt spread on an adjacent road. The contamination, in turn, had an adverse effect on fen vegetation; within the plumes, diverse vegetation was replaced by the more salt-tolerant narrow-leaf cattail (Typha angustifolia). Ground water of the third fen contained large concentrations of SO42- as high as 516 mg/L. The SO42- anomaly was observed on a transient and/or seasonal basis in the fen ground water and in an adjacent marsh and pond. Isotopically light delta(34)S values in these waters indicated that the addition of SO42- resulted from the oxidation of pyrite within underlying pear and/or pyritic gravel. However, the large SO42- concentrations had no discernible effect on fen vegetation. The results of this investigation indicate how easily construction of houses with private septic systems and deicing agents from roadway maintenance can contaminate fen ground water with relatively large concentrations of Na+ and Cl-, resulting in a significant loss of biodiversity in fens.

AB A seedling and sporeling emergence assay was conducted on 50 soil cores taken from within Carer stricta tussocks (intra-tussock) and from paired, adjacent inter-tussock areas in the Hawkins Conservation Area, South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA, to test the hypothesis that local heterogeneity in water levels alters seed bank composition and subsequent seedling emergence patterns. Soil cores were sliced into 2.5-cm-thick sections and split into flooded and drawn-down treatments. Germination of buried seeds and spores was assessed in these treatments under greenhouse conditions for 6 months. Eighteen species emerged from both treatments combined: 17 from inter-tussock samples and 12 from intra-tussock samples. Pooled across sample depths and watering treatments, more species of grasses, forbs (exclusive of Impatiens capensis), and woody plants germinated from intra-tussock samples, while more pteridophytes germinated from the inter-tussock samples. Emergence of pteridophytes, grasses, and forbs was associated significantly with sample depth. More pteridophytes germinated from samples close to the swamp surface, while grasses and forbs were most abundant in samples 10-20 cm below the surface. In the drawn-down treatment, pteridophyte and forb seedlings were more plentiful from inter-tussock samples. In contrast, more forb seedlings emerged from intra-tussock samples in the flooded treatment. This variation in forb emergence seems to reflect differences in species composition within and between tussocks. Twenty-two species occurred in the standing vegetation of the study area, but only nine of these also occurred in the seed bank. The composition of standing vegetation atop and between tussocks did not differ significantly. Grasses, which dominated the seed bank, were absent from standing vegetation. Grasses clearly represent a persistent population of seeds in the seed bank, while forbs are more transient within the seed bank. The depth-stratified species composition of the seed bank also suggests patterns of temporal succession in the aboveground vegetation of this New England tussock swamp.

AB The relationships between tissue nutrient content, species-specific productivity, and species abundance were investigated in seven emergent wetland species to determine how important a functional role phosphorus availability plays in controlling specific composition, abundance, and productivity in two naturally occurring Everglades wetland communities (sawgrass and wet prairie). Evidence from our tissue nutrient data suggest that the dominant taxa in each of these communities (Cladium jamaicense in the sawgrass community and Eleocharis spp. in the wet prairie community) are strongly limited by phosphorus and that the availability of this nutrient is important in controlling the productivity of each of these taxa. Cladium jamaicense had a significantly higher molar N:P ratio than either of the two other species, which were found to co-exist in the sawgrass community, suggesting that this species has extremely low requirements for phosphorus and, consequently, may be able to most effectively use phosphorus under conditions of low availability. Nutrient availability also seemed to be important to Peltandra virginica, although it seems that this species may be limited by nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus. Unlike both C. jamaicense and P. virginica, nutrient availability (either nitrogen or phosphorus) was insufficient to explain patterns of productivity or abundance for P. cordata, suggesting that some other environmental factor is more important for this species. In the wet prairie community, both Eleocharis spp. and the second most abundant species, Saggittaria lancifolia, had relationships that suggested that the productivity or abundance of both of these species is regulated by phosphorus availability. In contrast, Panicum hemitomon an important Everglades plant, did not show either productivity or abundance patterns that could be adequately explained in terms of nutrient availability. It seems more likely that, similar to P. cordata in the sawgrass community, some other environmental variable is more important than phosphorus availability-although the high N:P ratios in P, hemitomon leaf tissue do suggest that this species is phosphorus-limited. Furthermore, leaf tissue N:P data also suggested that Hymenocallis palmeri may be Limited entirely by nitrogen, rather than phosphorus.

TI Contiguity and edge characteristics of wetlands in five coastal counties
   of North Carolina, USA

LA English
DT Article

ID TRENDS
AB Wetland contiguity and edge were determined with a geographic information system (GIS) for five coastal counties in North Carolina, USA. The digital database was created from wetlands digitized from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands inventory maps. The GIS analysis was based on three classes of information: 1) all wetlands as one class; 2) wetlands separated by dominant vegetative community type (e.g., forest, shrub, or marsh); and 3) forest and shrub wetlands further separated by dominant vegetation (e.g., evergreen, deciduous, or mixed). The contiguity analysis supports the perception that the lower coastal plain counties are dominated by large contiguous wetlands When wetlands were clumped into one class, the number of wetlands > 1,000 ha ranged from 2 to 7 and the area accounted for 77 to 96% of the total wetland area. Several of those sites were > 100,000 ha in size. When wetlands were separated into more specific classes, the number of sites < 10 ha ranged from 416 to 3,370, but the wetland area in this size class was < 5% of the total wetland area. The average size of evergreen forest and shrub wetlands was typically much greater than deciduous forest and shrub wetlands, a reflection of the configuration of large, block pocosin wetlands. Percent edge was also typically lower for the evergreen forest and shrub wetlands than for deciduous forest and shrub wetlands. The counties with the highest number of wetland sites in transition to other uses have the most land owned by private timber companies. Contiguity analysis of wetlands with GIS provides landscape-scale information for natural resource management issues such as preserve design, habitat fragmentation, rare species management, and species migration opportunities.

ID GROWTH; PLANT
AB This study collected new data on sediment thickness and distribution and integrated it with existing data on the distribution of plant species within a small (0.5 ha) created, tidal salt marsh in Langley, Virginia, USA. The presence of the reed Phragmites australis was found to be inversely correlated with sediment accumulation on the marsh surface. Sediment-deficient areas seem at a higher risk for invasion by P. australis and subsequent loss of designed marsh habitat. The results indicate that areas of low sediment accumulation may be used as a proxy measure for areas vulnerable to invasion. These areas can be easily delimited both in the field and on aerial photography.

AB This study examined the usefulness of soil organic matter (SOM), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP) as indicators of resilience in forested wetlands located within southeast Virginia, USA. These data were also examined as standards for reference wetlands before and after timber harvesting and for comparisons of mature and early successional stages. Results indicate that the wetland soils in this study seem to be relatively resilient to perturbation. Soil total phosphorus was significantly greater in the 0- and 0.5-year stages than the 5-, 8-, and 11-year stages (p < 0.05). Although there were no significant differences in SOM, TOC, and TKN levels before and after timber harvest or between early and mature successional stages, there were consistent trends that may prove beneficial in determining reference standards. A Soil Perturbation Index was developed by combining all four parameters for soils collected in the Chowan River watershed to determine extent of deviation from the biogeochemical reference. Using the model developed in this study, biogeochemical functions decrease after harvesting, with the low point reached at approximately 8 to 9 years after human alteration. This index predicts that it would take 16-17 years for SOM, TOC, TKN, and TP to return to pre-harvest conditions. Perturbation indices could be used for assessment of human impacts, restoration projects, and mitigation of wetlands. We maintain that a Soil Perturbation Index can be one useful component of an index of biotic integrity for wetland ecosystems.

AB We analysed monthly the concentration of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH), a hydrophobic organic contaminant, in aqueous saturation extracts of the topsoil from five differently contaminated sites. beta-HCH concentration in the aqueous soil extract shows a high seasonal variability. Concentrations differ up to 60-fold with peaks up to 2.24 mu g l(-1). Higher beta-HCH concentrations were found in summer and autumn and accompanied by peaks in dissolved organic carbon concentration. This indicates the importance of dissolved organic matter for beta-HCH mobilization and the risks for groundwater pollution and plant uptake. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An unusually high incidence of mutations in a local population of red mangroves on the island of Trinidad was associated with locally elevated mercury levels in the underlying sediments. This restricted mercury contamination surrounded a large roost of scarlet ibises. Molted feathers of ibises using the roost had high concentrations of mercury, which were probably acquired by the birds during their annual migration to wetlands in South America contaminated with run-off from gold mining operations. Decades of molted feathers accumulating around the roost apparently has created the local contamination problem. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Contamination of Donana food-chains after the Aznalcollar mine disaster
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION

ID WILDLIFE
AB On 25 April 1998 part of the tailings pond dike of the Aznalcollar Zn mine north of the Guadalquivir marshes (Donana) in southern Spain collapsed releasing an estimated 5 million m(3) of acidic metal-rich waste. This event contaminated farmland and wetland up to >40 km downstream, including the 900-ha 'Entremuros', an important area for birds within the Donana world heritage site. In spite of the contamination, birds continued to feed in this area. Samples of two abundant macrophytes (Typha dominguensis and Scirpus maritimus) were taken from the Entremuros and nearby uncontaminated areas; these plants are important food items for several bird species. Analyses showed that in the Entremuros mean plant tissue concentrations of Cd were 3-40-fold (0.8-7.4 ppm) and Zn 20-100-fold (20-3384 ppm) greater than those from control areas. Comparable dietary concentrations of Zn have been reported to cause severe physiological damage to aquatic birds under experimental conditions. Elevated Cd concentrations are of concern as Cd bioconcentrates and is a cumulative poison. Metals released in this accident are moving into this food-chain and present a considerable risk to species feeding on Typha sp. and Scirpus sp. Many other food-webs exist in this area and require detailed examination to identify the species at risk, and to facilitate the management of these risks to minimise future impacts to the wildlife of Donana.

AB Breeding marsh harriers disappeared from the Ebro delta in the 1980s. Although marsh harrier breeding populations have recently increased in other wetlands of NE Spain, recolonization by breeding birds has not been observed in the Ebro delta, despite the fact that it is an important wintering area for the species. Lead (Pb) poisoning in marsh harriers, a problem described in other European wetlands, has been studied as a possible cause of this breeding impairment. Around 11% of harrier pellets (mainly with duck remains) contained Pb shot, and 52.5% of marsh harriers had blood [Pb] higher than 200 ng ml(-1). Maximum values for both parameters occurred in the middle of the hunting season. Blood [Pb] of wing-tagged marsh harriers classified as wintering birds was higher than those classified as migrant birds, and Pb levels decreased at the end of the hunting season. Body condition was not affected by blood [Pb], and none of the marsh harriers found dead had died of Pb poisoning. Birds with blood [Pb] higher than or equal to 601 ng ml(-1) returned to the Ebro delta in the next winter in a lower proportion (1/3) than birds with blood [Pb] lesser than or equal to 200 ng ml(-1) (6/6), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.083). Pb poisoning may affect populations of wintering marsh harriers, but other ecological and behavioural aspects have to be considered as well to explain the lack of breeding recolonization of the Ebro delta.

AB Riparian ecosystems in the semi-arid West of North America are diverse but have many similarities. The mountains landscape with wide range of latitude, longitude, and elevation offers diverse opportunities for streamside vegetation. All riparian ecosystems in the region are dependent on supplemental water, usually form the shallow, valley alluvial aquifer. Western riparian ecosystems provide several ecological services. The stabilize streambanks, trap sediment, improve water quality, and help control or modulate hydrologic processes. They function as habitat for many western animal species, serving as a small mesic island or strip within an arid landscape. They also serve as recreational sites for humans. Riparian systems are controlled by interacting hydrologic and geomorphic processes. Floods may alter river channel characteristics and the extent of riparian vegetation while enhancing recruitment of riparian species and recharging the alluvial water table. Geomorphic features, such as canyons and valleys, control the size of the riparian zone, as well as depth of the water table. Driving variables may differ from north to south, especially hydrology. For example, northern riparian zones are influenced by ice scour, while southern zones often have flash floods. Riparian systems occur along spatial and temporal gradients. Along elevation gradients, riparian vegetation may change from simple deciduous forests to mixed deciduous to coniferous and possibly alpine wetlands. Differences among channel, terrace, and upland plant communities decrease with increasing elevation as moisture stress decreases. Temporal gradients occur within a location in the riparian zone as early pioneer communities such as cottonwood/willow give way to late successional communities such as mesquite or sagebrush, often a consequence of sediment accumulation. Many similarities among wester riparian ecosystems exist because several dominant genera (e.g., Populus) are common throughout the West, and many geomorphic and hydrologic processes that influence riparian establishment are similar. Western riparian ecosystems have been greatly altered by human activity. Major factors include natural resource use, ubranization, alteration of stream flows through dam construction and ground-water withdrawal, modification of biotic conditions through grazing, agriculture, and introduction of non-native species, and alteration within watersheds. Better understanding of the ecology of western riparian ecosystems will increase potential for restoration and protection of remaining areas.

ID DE-SANTA-CLARA; MEXICO; CONSERVATION; WETLAND
AB The lower Colorado River mainstem and delta have been severely damaged by a variety of human-related activities, including river impoundment, agriculture, water diversions, introduction of exotic plants and fishes. and ground-water pumping. In some areas, the native wetland habitat that formerly dominated this region has disappeared completely. Nevertheless, there are areas where significant wetland habitat persists as a result of incidental circumstances or purposeful restoration actions. These areas provide important conservation and restoration opportunities. In this investigation, nine restoration efforts along the lower Colorado River from Parker Dam to the delta region were evaluated to learn how lessons from these experiences can benefit future ecological restoration efforts. In addition, Lye assessed the general ecological condition of this reach to identify critical native wetland plant communities and recommend strategies for protecting these areas in the future. It is apparent that wetland ecosystems in both the delta and the mainstem would benefit if effluent waters were allocated to support wetlands rather than allocated to evaporative basins. Other important strategies for improving the ecological condition of the river should include altering reservoir releases, improving the effectiveness of revegetation efforts, and developing bi-national, collaborative approaches involving local communities and landowners to identify and carry out projects that benefit both them and the ecological condition of the river.

AB Reflectance spectra (414-948 nm) were recorded at ground level from leaves and canopies of subalpine marsh macrophytes near Lake Tahoe, California in 1994. Canopy architecture of the dominant species suggested that canopy reflectance should differ from one another: yellow pond-lily (Nuphar polysepalum) has a horizontal canopy; hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) has a vertical canopy; beaked sedge (Carex rostrata) has a spherical (randomly distributed) canopy. Data were used to 1) analyze effects of canopy architecture on reflectance properties, 2) examine effects of canopy architecture on use of spectral vegetation indices as predictors of biomass, and 3) develop methods for detecting species distributions. Leaf reflectance spectra were different in shape and magnitude across the spectrum, with canopy architecture and cover having marked effects on albedo and wavelength-dependent variance among samples. Nuphar polysepalum (horizontal canopy) showed the least difference between canopy and leaf reflectance, S. acutus (vertical canopy) reflectance was most affected by canopy architecture, and C. rostrata (spherical canopy) was intermediate. Reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) region was strongly reduced, while reflectance in the visible region was minimally affected, producing small red/NIR differences and low vegetation indices. Seven vegetation indices were tested for correlation with plant biomass. Fresh and dry green biomass of C. rostrata were significantly correlated with all indices (p<0.002), while no correlation was found between any index and fresh or dry green biomass of N. polysepalum (p>0.13) or S. acutus (p>0.21), suggesting that spectral indices as estimators of biomass assume a spherical vegetation canopy. Differences between Thematic Mapper (TM) bands 3 (red) and 2 (green) normalized by the sum of reflectance ((TM3 - TM2)/(TM3 divided by TM2)), was significantly different among species (p<0.05) and was used as the basis of a supervised classification of a large Lake Tahoe marsh. The classification agrees with the data on distributions of species and expected distributions in relation to water depth.

TI Bias in quadrat-derived estimates of number of prairie wetlands
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE bias; correction; estimation; prairie pothole region; South Dakota;
   quadrat sampling; wetland
AB Estimates of number of wetlands derived from quadrat sampling are inherently biased when wetlands on quadrat boundaries are counted. Bias complicates comparisons of wetland density or abundance between years or studies, or between regions with different wetland sizes. Simulated quadrat sampling was conducted to evaluate the magnitude of bias in estimates of the number of temporary, seasonal, semipermanent, and total wetlands from samples of square quadrats of different sizes. All estimates were biased except for number of temporary wetlands derived from samples of the largest quadrats. Bias ranged from + 101% (SE = 0.39%) for estimates of the number of semipermanent wetlands sampled with 0.64 km(2) quadrats to + 0.19% (SE = 0.19%) for the number of temporary wetlands sampled with 25.60 km(2) quadrats. Bias was greatest when large wetlands were sampled using small quadrats and was related to quadrat perimeter:area ratio (km/km(2)) and to quadrat size. Managers and researchers should correct for bias in estimates of number of wetlands by deriving correction factors with the equations presented or by deriving correction factors using aerial photographs to determine the geometric centers of wetlands in and around a subset of sample quadrats.

AB We examined the physical and ecological characteristics of ecotones between longleaf pine/wiregrass upland and seasonally-ponded isolated wetlands dominated by herbaceous species in a fire-maintained karst landscape of Southwestern Georgia. The-purpose of this study was to 1) examine patterns of plant species richness across,the upland/wetland transitional zone relative to elevation and moisture gradients; 2) identify discontinuities (boundaries) of soil morphological characteristics, soil moisture, soil nutrient availability, and vegetation and their spatial relationships in the ecotone; and 3) examine the degree of coincidence of ecological thresholds with that of jurisdictional wetland/upland boundaries. Transects from upland to wetland were established relative to hydric soil boundaries for measurements of vegetation abundance, biomass, volumetric soil moisture, oxidation reduction potential, relative elevation, soil textural analysis by horizon, and available nitrogen and phosphorous. We used a moving windows analysis and multivariate analyses to examine ecological, discontinuities in the ecotone. Ground-cover species richness was high along all transects with a peak in species richness in the non-hydric ecotonal zone. Abrupt changes in vegetation and environmental variables (soil moisture, soil depth to argillic horizon, and soil texture) were generally located below the hydric soil boundary and are likely related to frequent fire regimes. Discrepancies occurred in the determination of hydrophytic vegetation depending on methodology. These results have implications for the conservation of regional diversity, for depressional wetland restoration, and for regulatory decisions.

AB We quantified geomorphic and vegetational characteristics of 22 first-to-fourth order riverine forests located in the inner coastal plain of North Carolina. We used Detrended Correspondence Analysis to compare canopy composition among sites and relate measured environmental parameters to distribution of canopy trees and stream order. Both geomorphic and vegetational attributes could be used to functionally divide first-to-fourth order riverine systems into 17 headwater (first and second order streams) and 5 midreach systems (third and fourth order streams). As expected, stream order was found to be positively correlated (P<0.003) with drainage basin size, floodplain width, and channel width. The canopy of headwater reaches was dominated by various combinations of Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa biflora, and Acer rubrum, while midreach systems were typically dominated by Taxodium distichum and/or Nyssa aquatica. Canopy composition was similar to other low order stream floodplains in the southeastern USA from Alabama to Maryland. However, the canopy composition of bottomlands differed in that the genera Fraxinus, Quercus, and Ulmus were generally less important in the North Carolina bottomlands than elsewhere in the Southeast. Metrics obtained from these relatively unaltered ecosystems could be used to develop standards for assessing of wetland condition and provide appropriate criteria for designing restoration of altered low order riverine ecosystems.

AB The Santa Margarita River is one of the few remaining free-flowing river systems on the Southern California coastal plain, and it provides one of the most expansive, unspoiled riparian habitats in Southern California. Then is concern among resource managers that the cumulative impacts associated with rapid development of the upper watershed will degrade the ecological integrity of the entire watershed. In response to this concern, we assessed the impacts of development projects in this watershed, which were subject to regulation under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Cumulative impacts were assessed by comparing the conditions present at each project site prior to issuance of the Section 404 permit to conditions present after issuance of the permit. Changes between pre- and post-project site conditions were evaluated using a semantic categorization for the following six criteria: endangered species habitat, structural diversity, spatial diversity, undeveloped open space, linear contiguity, and adjacent habitat. The impact assessment showed that although the Section 404 permit program has attenuated project impacts, it has failed at minimizing cumulative impacts. Projects permitted under Section 404 contributed to the disruption of movement corridors linking the habitats of the upper and lower watershed and resulted in extensive floodplain encroachment, which may have hydrologic as well as ecological implications. More importantly, this assessment identified the types of activities and habitat functions that should be addressed during revisions in permitting procedures and should be emphasized in the watershed planning process. These conclusions will be incorporated into an ongoing Advanced Identification study sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop a management plan for the Santa Margarita Watershed.

AB Boron is present in many household, industrial, and municipal products and by-products. Uncontrolled release of boron-containing materials into wetland environments could cause toxicity in bottom-land and swamp tree species. To test this hypothesis, boron was added to 10-liter pots containing seedlings of Betula nigra, Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora, Nyssa aquatica, Platanus occidentalis, Taxodium distichum, Quercus alba, Q. falcata var. pagodaefolia, Q. nigra, Q. michauxii, and Q. phellos at rates of 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg/L, and the seedlings grown for four months. Elemental leaf concentrations, growth, and biomass were determined. Boron concentration in leaves was linearly related to boron addition. The highest boron treatment significantly decreased growth for B. nigra, N. aquatica, P. occidentalis, and T. distichum. Platanus occidentalis had the highest boron recovery (23% at 4 mg/L), while T. distichum had the most consistent recovery (11-13%) over all treatments. Although leaf damage was severe in the oaks, there were no significant differences in growth parameters between the control and boron treatments. This is attributed to the determinate growth of the oaks and possibly the short duration of the study.

AB We examined protein and energy production of potential migratory bird foods produced in moist-soil managed versus unmanaged playa wetlands on the Southern High Plains of Texas (SHP) during fall and winter 1994-95 and 1995-96 to assess potential carrying capacity for wintering migratory birds. Total food (seeds and invertebrates) biomass, crude protein production, and gross energy production were greater in managed playas than unmanaged playas. There was no difference in food biomass or energy production between invertebrates and seeds when managed and unmanaged playas were combined, but protein production from invertebrates was greater than production from seeds. The estimated 160,000 ha of unmanaged playa wetland habitat in the SHP produces about 24.3 million kg of seeds and invertebrates, 9.2 million kg of protein, and 108.6 billion kcal of energy. When these playas have water, there are enough seeds and invertebrates to support 3 million ducks for 3 months. However, water is often limited, making much of this habitat unavailable to waterbirds in most years. Therefore, conservation of existing playas should be supplemented with intensive moist-soil management in some areas as the most economical strategy for providing proper nutrition to migratory birds and other wildlife in playas.

TI Wetland policymaking in the US Congress from 1789 to 1995
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE wetland policymaking; US Congress
AB Congressional policymaking has a significant impact on the management of wetlands in the United States. Both the congressional committees and witnesses who participate in hearings play significant roles in helping define wetland policy. This research examines congressional 240 hearings and 1569 witnesses who testified from 1789 to 1995 on wetlands. Based on key issues from witnesses and the committees who set the agenda, the findings show that three distinct eras exist in wetland policymaking in Congress. Era I (1789-1945) was characterized by a dominant monopoly of agricultural and development issues in congressional policymaking. Agricultural committees dominated in framing the debate by controlling the hearings and legislative discussion of issues during this time period. A significant break-up of these dominant agricultural issues occurred in Era II from 1946-1965 with the early beginning of public attention to environmental issues and the start of scientific investigation into wetlands. However, since Era III, which began in 1966, wetland policymaking in Congress has been highly conflictual, with no single committee or witness dominating. The growth of wetland science and continued public interest in wetlands presents a challenge to the dominant agricultural and development interests that once controlled congressional policymaking. Unlike in Era I, wetland congressional policymaking today reflects many different issues and participants without a dominant monopoly that controls the issue. Wetland policy debates no longer focus solely on agricultural concerns but have expanded and been re-defined to include issues such as leisure, environmental protection, private property, and economics. Chi Square tests and a regression analysis demonstrate the strong relationship among hearings, venues, and witnesses. A major conclusion drawn from the study is that congressional wetland policymaking is a more open and democratic process than in earlier eras.

ID STREAM
AB A study was conducted under greenhouse conditions to examine the effects of various soil moisture regimes on black willow (Salix nigra) posts (cuttings). Five treatments representing a range of soil moisture regimes, from continuous flooding to mild drought, were imposed separately. A well-watered, well-drained treatment served as the control. Leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis), survival, and biomass production of posts were evaluated. The stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis data clearly demonstrated the sensitivity:of willow posts to low oxygen conditions (under flooded treatments) as well as to soil drought. Growth and biomass were also adversely affected by flooding and drought treatments. The patterns of roof development along the posts seemed to be associated with the watering regime. Root biomass was depressed in zones subjected to flooding and low soil redox potential. In addition, leaf area, leaf biomass, and shoot (leaf + branch) biomass were significantly lower in the continuously-hooded and drought treatments as compared to control plants. Results indicated that maximum photosynthesis and growth in willow posts required ample soil-moisture (but-non-waterlogging conditions) and adequate drainage in the top 60 cm of soil. The use of willow posts for streambank restoration remains as a viable strategy; however, considerations should be given to water-table elevations, soil Eh conditions, soil moisture regime, and soil texture in order to improve the prospect for successful results.

TI Wetland credit sales as a strategy for achieving no-net-loss: The
   limitations of regulatory conditions
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE mitigation; wetland credits; ecological success; financial success;
   wetland regulation and policy
AB Wetland restoration and creation has been undertaken by the private sector, by public agencies, and by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in order to create wetland credits for sale to wetland permit recipients. The permit recipients use credits purchased from these commercial sales ventures as compensation for activities permitted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of the United States and related state and local government programs. For commercial sales ventures to make a positive contribution to achieving no-net-loss of wetlands, the credits sold must be ecologically successful, ventures must receive prices adequate to cover their credit production costs, and fill permit recipients must be willing and able to pay the resulting prices. From the perspective of the individual sales venture, costs and required prices are affected by 1) regulatory conditions governing when the wetland credits are sold, 2) the cost of gaining regulatory approval to sell credits, and 3) the future certainty of wetland credit demand. The consequences of these three factors for costs, prices, and availability of wetland credits are illustrated using a financial simulation of a hypothetical wetland restoration activity. A discussion of the results of the financial simulations and of barriers to competition among sales ventures leads to the conclusion that there are significant limits to achieving no net loss in the regulatory program through wetland credit sales.

AB Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var, blflora) seedlings were exposed to flooding and salinity conditions simulating the chronic exposure of sea-level rise and the acute exposure of hurricane storm surge. Chronically exposed seedlings were either watered or hooded with 0, 2, or 10 ppt salinity. Those in the acute experiment were watered or flooded with freshwater until exposed to a 21-ppt salinity surge for 48 hours. Freshwater flooding reduced photosynthesis (A), water pressure potential (Psi), height, and stem and root biomass for swamp tupelo while biomass of buttonbush roots decreased and stem increased. Chronic watering with 2 ppt salinity reduced height, basal diameter, and stem and root biomass for swamp tupelo but did not significantly affect buttonbush. Both species were negatively affected by watering with 10 ppt salinity, with total mortality of swamp tupelo. Flooding with 2 ppt salinity also caused a 100% mortality for swamp tupelo. All buttonbush seedlings survived with reduced A, Psi, and stem and root biomass. Plants chronically flooded with 10 ppt salinity were more affected, with drastically decreased A, stomatal conductance (g(s)), and Psi within the first day of treatment and all dying within three weeks. Watering with 21 ppt salinity reduced A and g(s) of both species during the second day of the surge, but buttonbush recovered within the next 20 days. Flooding with 21-ppt saline water also greatly impacted buttonbush, which did not recover as when watered with 21 ppt salinity. Swamp tupelo was already stressed due to flooding and showed no further reduction in A or g( s) due to the 21-ppt salinity flood surge. Buttonbush seedlings were more tolerant of salinity and flooding conditions than swamp tupelo seedlings, although it is unlikely that either species could survive long-term exposure to 10-ppt salinity flooding.

AB Algorithms that quantitatively define the stem buttress and the magnitude of stem hypertrophy were developed and used to determine the relationship between tree form and surface water hydrologic regime in baldcypress (Taxodium distichum). Regression analysis using inundation index (I; defined as the average number of inundation days per year over a 49- year period) as the independent variable and extent of buttress (B-e) as the dependent variable described the relationship by B-e = 52.84+0.111I. The equation (P<0.001) explains approximately 68% of the variation in the relationship. Mean stem form of upland control populations was not significantly different from the stem form predicted from the equation for inundation indices equal to zero (the y-intercept, which corresponds to an upland situation). The use of stem form algorithms of T. distichum shows promise as a source of historical hydrologic information useful in research and management situations.

AB Six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin, USA are in regional hydrogeologic settings with large discharges of calcareous ground water. These settings juxtapose topographically high areas of ground-water recharge with fens in lower areas of discharge, thus creating steep upward hydraulic gradients at the fens. Coarse glacial deposits with high permeability connect recharge areas to discharge areas and transmit large amounts of ground water to the fens. Calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin are associated with two regional landforms, river terraces and glacial moraines. The calcareous drift is the likely source of carbonate for the fens; carbonate bedrock is not required. Five of the calcareous fens form peat aprons over broad areas of diffuse ground-water discharge on river terraces. One of the calcareous fens is a peat dome over an aquifer window, a relatively small area (about 15-m radius) of localized ground-water discharge through a breach in the clayey confining layer of the underlying aquifer. Carbonate content of calcareous fen peat averaged about 27% (calcium carbonate equivalent, dry weight basis) in the surface layer, which commonly overlies a carbonate-depleted zone with a carbonate content of 10% or less. Hydraulic conductivity (K) of calcareous fen peat determined from slug tests ranged from 2.7 x 10(-7) to 9.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) and had a geometric mean of 3.8 x 10(-6) m s(-1). These values likely underestimate the true horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-h) and overestimate the true vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) because of errors in assumptions commonly used in slug-test analyses. Median (over time) hydraulic heads in wells screened below the base of the peat ranged from about 25 to 69 cm above the peat surface. Upward vertical gradients (dimensionless) through the peat ranged from 0.040 to 0.209. Vertical ground-water discharge was calculated by Darcy's Law and ranged from 2 to 172 L m(-2) d(-1). Because of bias in estimating K-v, these values likely overestimate the true vertical ground-water discharge and indicate the importance of better field methods to estimate K, especially K-v. Calcareous fens may need water tables sustained near the peat surface by large vertical ground-water discharges to allow carbonate precipitation, which is associated with the rare fen vegetation.

AB Profile beards are commonly used to estimate vertical cover of herbaceous vegetation in the evaluation of wildlife habitat. However, data from this technique are seldom collected or analyzed in a consistent manner. Therefore, we investigated and evaluated methods of profile-board data collection and analysis using univariate and multivariate techniques. We collected 11,056 samples of vertical-structure data (percent cover) at 2,764 points in 8 playa wetlands in the Southern High Plains of Texas during 1989 and 1990. Visual obstruction data were collected along 5 transects in each playa, with 4 subsamples taken at each point. Data from strata of a profile board rarely followed a normal distribution. Observations among strata were correlated. initial analysis with a multivariate technique to simultaneously test data from all strata is recommended to control experiment-wise error rates. Only when a significant effect is determined in initial analyses should other multivariate techniques or univariate analyses follow to assess differences. Collecting >1 observation per sampling point (i.e., subsampling) did not affect analysis and is only necessary when subsamples are not correlated. Sampling should be stratified throughout a habitat to account for structural variation within a habitat. Transforming percent cover into scores reduced differences among habitat units and may result in a misrepresentation of the data due to the potential for an indication of plant cover despite no vegetation occurring. When estimating a population mean, we recommend a minimum sample size of 20 points/habitat unit and arcsine transforming percent data to achieve acceptable type 1 error rates. When comparing 2 or more habitats or experimental treatments, arcsine transformation of percent data is not necessary. General procedural recommendations for use of profile board are (1) use a board that is relative in height and strata size to vegetation/animal of interest, (2) use equally spaced strata to avoid biasing results to certain stratum, (3) determine the distance from which to read the board by calculating the distance that results in the most variation in cover values, and (4) use one observer or randomize observers among experimental units.

ID WATER; HEAT; EVAPORATION; FLUX
AB This study examines the effects of different disturbance histories, specifically patterns of ditching and drainage on wetland evapotranspiration rates for two sites within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Indiana, USA. The effect of drainage at the disturbed site is to lower the water table and to reduce the depth and duration of inundation. Evapotranspiration was measured as its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux, within the framework of the surface energy balance using the eddy correlation approach. Results show that when standing water is present at each site, there is very similar flux partitioning; the latent heat flux accounts for approximately 50% of the net radiation (approximately 3.5 mm d(-1)), storage heat Bur 30%, and sensible heat flux 20%. When the disturbed site has no standing water, evapotranspiration rates are maintained at, the same level (3.5-3.75 mm d(-1)), but the storage heat flux drops significantly, and the sensible heat flux is enhanced. Excellent results are obtained with the Penman Monteith evapotranspiration model using a very small surface resistance (5 s m(-1)) when there is no standing water. Although the absolute magnitudes of the results reported are directly relevant only to similar sites in the Midwest USA in summer, the processes and controls described are representative of wetlands located near large water bodies (like Lake Michigan) subjected to diurnal lake (sea) breezes, with vascular vegetation, and a water table at or very close to the surface.

AB Reserves of buried seeds are known to have an important role in the dynamics of plant communities. This is particularly so in wetlands, where periodic low water events are essential for plants to reestablish from seeds. In spite of the growing literature on reserves of buried seeds, little is known about this resource in beaver ponds. This study was designed to 1) document species found in beaver pond seed banks, 2) estimate their relative abundance, and 3) test whether the abundance and richness of seeds differ between young and old beaver ponds. Soil samples were collected from 14 beaver ponds in Gatineau Park (Quebec) in May 1995. Samples were spread out in plastic trays containing a sand and peat substrate and were placed in a growth chamber with fluctuating light and temperature regimes to stimulate germination. More than 2000 seedlings representing 42 species germinated from the various soil samples, yielding an estimated density of 2300 seedlings/m(2). Juncus effusus (426 seeds/m(2)), Leersia oryzoides (390 seeds/m(2)), Scirpus cyperinus (246seeds/m(2)), Juncus brevicaudatus (170 seeds/m2), and Ludwiga palustris (98 seeds/m(2)) were the 5 most abundant species. The abundance and richness of germinating seeds did not differ significantly between young and old beaver ponds.

AB Palm Swamp Forests in the Caribbean region have been little studied although they are found in many countries. in Trinidad, they are an important component of the vegetation in the Nariva Swamp, a Ramsar site. The distribution and ecology of plants in Roystonea oleracea Palm Swamp Forest was studied using selected study plots. The forest had an open canopy with palms up to 26 m tall and a density of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh of 380 per hectare. The Roystonea palm contributed 55.8% of individuals and was the most important of seven tree species greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh. Seventy-four species were found, with most being understory shrubs and herbs. Peak ripe fruit availability was from August to November and was correlated with rainfall. The palm forest canopy appears to be relatively even aged, with lower non-palm trees giving an all-aged height and dbh distribution in the forest. The forest developed in conditions of low water levels, low salinity, and a hydroperiod that allows seed germination and seedling establishment during the early wet season. However, the forest undergrowth seems to be becoming dominated by terrestrial vegetation with palm seedlings unable to survive.

AB This pilot study assessed elemental distribution of lead shot in a tidal marsh that has been used heavily for hunting for generations by First Nation Cree of the western James Bay region of northern Ontario, Canada. Soil and vegetation (live shoots and rhizomes separately) were sampled at 25 plots along a 480-m transect. Metal content of lead shot affected soils was at background levels compared to soils of rural Ontario with Pb 7.4 +/- 0.9 mu g/g; As 3.7 +/- 0.6 mu g/g; Sb < 0.05 mu g/kg; Cd 0.04 +/- 0.03 mu g/g; Cr 37.1 +/- 2.0 mu g/g; Cu 9.3 +/- 2.6 mu g/g; and Mn 351 +/- 16 mu g/g. A direct correlation between soil Pb and plant biomass was not evident, and Pb contents of shoots (3.1 +/- 0.8 mu g/g) and rhizomes (2.8 +/- 0.6 mu g/g) were at background levels, suggesting minimal uptake of Pb from the soil. The results suggest that Pb pellets were relatively inert in the alkaline soil of the western James Bay region (mean pH = 7.7, range 7.4 to 7.9), being of limited consequence when considering environmental contamination.

   North Dakota - An energy-budget study
SO WETLANDS

DE energy-budget; evaporation; prairie wetland
ID WATER
AB Evaporation from Wetland P1 in the Cottonwood Lake area of North Dakota, USA was determined by the energy-budget method for 1982-85 and 1987. Evaporation rates were as high as 0.672 cm day(-1). Incoming: solar radiation, incoming atmospheric radiation, and long-wave radiation emitted from the water body are the largest energy fluxes to and from the wetland. Because of the small heat storage of the water body, evaporation rates closely track solar radiation on shea time scales. The effect of advected energy related to precipitation is small because the water quickly heats up by solar radiation following precipitation. Advected energy related to ground water is minimal because ground-water fluxes are small and groundwater temperature is only about 7 degrees C. Energy flux related to sediment heating and thermal storage in the sediments, which might be expected to be large because the water is clear and shallow, affects evaporation rates by less than 5 percent.

AB Surveys for interior wetland birds at mine-associated emergent wetlands on coal surface mines in southern Illinois detected one state threatened and two state endangered species. Breeding by least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) and common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) was confirmed. Regional assessment of potential wetland bird habitat south of Illinois Interstate 64 identified a total of 8,109 ha of emergent stable water wetlands; 10% were associated with mining. Mine-associated wetlands with persistent hydrology and large expanses of emergent vegetation provide habitat that could potentially compensate for loss of natural wetlands in Illinois. We encourage identification and management of such areas and reclamation of mined areas to wetlands where possible.

AB Both vertebrate herbivores and fire have long been known to have dramatic and important effects on wetland vegetation. However, the interactive effects of burning and herbivory have received less attention. In this study, conducted in the coastal marshes of the Pearl River Basin in Louisiana, USA, both the effects of herbivory and fire as well as the interaction between these effects were examined in three marsh community types: Sagittaria lancifolia, Panicum virgatum, and Spartina patens. At five sites for each of the three community types, the effects of burning and fencing to exclude herbivores were determined over two years.
   Results showed that total biomass was reduced by burning bur increased by fencing, with no interactive effects on total biomass. Species density (the number of species per unit area) was enhanced in plots that were both burned and fenced. Spartina patens was an important component in all three communities. Cover estimates indicated that S. patens responded to burning and fencing differently from the other dominant species. In the Panicum virgatum community, P. virgatum cover was enhanced by burning and fencing while S. patens cover was reduced. In the Sagittaria lancifolia community, S. lancifolia and Vigna luteola were enhanced by burning and fencing while S. patens was reduced. In the S. patens community, Scirpus americanus was enhanced by fencing, but burning had no significant effect on cover of either dominant species. These and other data are generally consistent with the hypothesis that herbivory favors S. patens while burning favors other dominant species. Thus, the relative effects of fire and herbivory have an influence(along with other factors such as salinity) on the dominance of S. patens in coastal marshes.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of metaphyton, periphyton, phytoplankton, and water-column primary productivity were studied in two 1-ha newly constructed riparian freshwater marshes (one planted with macrophytes and the other unplanted) at the Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Surface cover and mid-summer biomass of metaphyton, biomass and production of periphyton and phytoplankton, and water-column primary productivity were sampled from July to November 1994. Methods of spatial statistics were used to examine the spatial patterns in surface coverage and mid-summer biomass of metaphyton. Our results showed that for both wetlands, dense mars of metaphyton (up to 86% surface coverage) acted as nutrient "filters" shaping the spatial distribution of nutrients that in turn affected the spatial pattern of metaphyton by limiting the growth at locations further away from inflow. Metaphyton cover was strongly correlated with phosphorus retention and also influenced the spatial pattern of periphyton and water-column primary productivity. There was no significant difference between the two wetlands in the production and spatial distribution of metaphyton and phytoplankton or water-column primary productivity.

ID GENERATION
AB On June 8 1993, a beaver dam on Rocky Creek, a small stream in central Alberta, failed and released about 7500 m(3) of water. The estimated peak of the resulting flood wave was 15 m(3) s(-1), which is 3.5 times the maximum discharge recorded for the creek over 23 years. The flood wave destroyed five hydrometric stations, scoured some channel reaches, and deposited sediment in others. Large trees and debris from old beaver dams were carried downstream and deposited in piles across the channel and adjacent banks. The flood wave peak was dampened to 6% of the estimated upstream flood peak as it passed through a 90-ha wetland characterized by both organic and mineral soils, sedge meadow and willow, and containing a small lake and several beaver ponds. Although the peak flow resulting from the dam outburst was extreme, the volume, most of which was probably detained in the wetland, was not. The volume amounted to only 7% of the combined basin runoff from precipitation and the beaver dam outburst. This extreme event showed that beaver activity can greatly affect the hydrology of small streams and demonstrated the importance of taking wetland storage into account when conducting hydrologic studies on watersheds that contain sizeable areas of wetlands.

AB Wetlands systems generally are considered as filters, retaining allochthonous metals that can have toxic effects on biota. We investigated patterns of spatial variability in trace metal concentrations in sediments and tissues of Phragmites australis in the marshes of the Danube Delta, Romania in 1993 and 1994. Mean concentrations (+/- s.e.) of Ni, Cr, and Pb in roots were 10.0 +/- 0.7, 3.7 +/- 0.2, and 11.3 +/- 0.5 mu g g(-1) dry we, respectively, and in leaves were 0.3 +/- 0.1, 0.1 +/- 0.0, 0.2 +/- 0.0 mu g g(-1) dry wt, respectively. Mean concentrations (+/- s.e.) of Ni, Cr, Zn, and Cu extracted (0.5 M HCl) from sediments were 16.4 +/- 0.8, 3.0 +/- 0.2, 45.4 +/- 1.7, and 29.2 +/- 2.3 mu g g(-1) dry wt, respectively. Sediment metal concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.01) with distance from the Delta origin, but concentrations in roots and sediments did not vary with distance into the marsh from lake edges nor with distance from main river channels in the Delta. Concentrations of extractable metals from marsh sediments were not correlated to concentrations in roots, suggesting that factors other than labile concentrations in sediments control metal uptake and storage in roots.

AB Birds were surveyed by censusing strip transects monthly from October 1990 through September 1991 in seven created and seven natural salt marshes located in lower Galveston Bay. All birds observed using the transect, the airspace above the transect, and 5m of bay bottom adjacent to the transect were recorded. Species richness and species diversity were calculated for each salt marsh and compared between natural and created sites. Species richness and diversity were greater in natural salt marshes due to the occurrence of migratory waterfowl, wintering shorebirds, and typical marsh species such as rails and marsh sparrows. Birds using created salt marshes consisted primarily of gulls and terns, especially during the nesting season. Bird density was greater in natural marshes during fall and winter months, while created marshes had higher bird density from March through July. Created salt marshes provided bird habitat, however not necessarily for the same species assemblage as natural salt marshes.

AB In tidal freshwater marshes of the Hudson River, coverage by Phragmites australis and Lythrum salicaria has increased greatly over the past twenty years, although Typha angustifolia is still the predominant vegetation. Prior to any attempts at marsh restoration via removal of exotic/invasive plant species, we wanted to describe the current relationship between these plants and sediment nutrient pools. Extant stands (n=3 of each) of T. angustifolia, L. salicaria, and P. autstralis were sampled with porewater equilibrators in the spring and summer of 1995 and summer 1996 to measure porewater ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate. Porewater pools of phosphate were significantly lower (p<0.05) in stands of L. salicaria in summer, with concentrations only half those measured in stands of P. australis and T. augustifolia. Porewater ammonium did not differ among plant communities, and nitrate was undetectable in sediments associated with all three communities. Sequestration of nutrients in above-ground biomass differed significantly among plant species, indicating differential demand on sediment nutrient pools. There were significant decreases in porewater ammonium from spring to summer. Growing season estimates of nitrogen incorporation into above-ground plant tissue are more than adequate to explain the removal of ammonium from porewater for all plant communities. Similarly, plant uptake of porewater phosphate was several times greater than springtime standing stocks of dissolved inorganic P. Concentrations of porewater phosphate remained high in the summer, indicating rapid replenishment from other sediment phosphorus pools. Depletion of porewater ammonium in the summer and low N:P in plant tissues suggest N Limitation of these marsh plants. Our data suggest that marsh management practices intended to shift the relative vegetation coverage towards native and non-invasive species should consider the subtle but ecologically significant effects on nutrient cycling.

AB We studied waterfowl use of grass-sage stock ponds in north-central Wyoming during the 1988 and 1989 breeding seasons. Dabbling ducks, particularly mallards, were the most common breeders. indicated breeding pair density averaged 2.7 pairs/ha of wetland surface, while brood density averaged 1.0 brood/ha of wetland surface. Waterfowl use and productivity were greatest on large (>3 ha), clear, deep ponds with grass shorelines and abundant submergent macrophytes. Pair use was positively correlated with water clarity, pond area, and macroinvertebrate diversity. Brood use was related to macroinvertebrate diversity, pond depth, and Shoreline Development index. We recommend management priority be given to ponds that are deeper than 1 m to provide more water that is clear so macrophytes can be established. Macroinvertebrates should be artificially introduced into ponds. Fencing should be used to improve ponds for waterfowl use and brood rearing.

AB Greentree reservoir (GTR) management is a common waterfowl habitat management technique used in both the northeastern and southeastern United States. However, this management technique is controversial because greentree reservoir management can cause changes in forest composition and structure. We studied the effects of GTR management at the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge in central New York by comparing vegetation in permanent plots in two GTRs and a natural forested wetland over a 30-year period (preflood and 2 years and 18 years after flood cessation). We detected long-term effects of GTR management on vegetation composition and structure. Red maple and green ash remained the dominant overstory species, but density of green ash saplings was higher (P = 0.026) in a natural forested wetland (300 trees/ha) compared to the two GTRs (30-90 trees/ha). Age determination of several green ash saplings suggests these changes were Likely caused by reduced regeneration in the GTRs. Mortality of green ash seedlings in 1996 was greatest in a GTR flooded for 1 year (60%) versus an unflooded GTR (12%) and a natural forested wetland (27%). Overall, shrub density was similar 18 years post-flooding and preflooding, but several species had lower densities (P = 0.001-0.031) than a natural forested wetland. Shannon-Weiner diversity index (1.8-2.0) and richness (29-31) of herbaceous species were similar among all sites 18 years after flood cessation. However, two species of fern remained at lower densities (P=0.0001-0.026), while three herbaceous species remained at higher densities (P=0.0001-0.015) 18 years after flood cessation as compared to preflood densities and densities in a natural forested wetland. It is unknown after which year of flooding these changes occurred, but 12 years of GTR management did cause long-term effects on the forest community.

AB We examined spatial and diel availability of flying insects that are a critical food resource to young ducklings. We sampled insects in three native prairie wetlands on the Woodworth Study Area of south-central North Dakota. Insects were sampled with floating sticky traps within emergent macrophyte, edge, and open water microhabitat zones. Sampling took place from 12 June to 4 July 1995, a period that coincided with peak dabbling duck (Anas spp.) hatching in this region. Our sticky traps collected 28,527 insects and spiders totaling at least 32 families and 150 species. Chironomidae (Diptera) was the most abundant group, constituting 60% of the total insect count and 32.9% of the biomass (mg dry weight). Mixed-model ANOVA showed that a population of similar undisturbed wetlands may show differences in insect availability when considering both time and space, primarily due to differences in community structure among sites. In spite of these significant random effects, interactions between or among the fixed date, zone, and trap-height effects significantly influenced insect availability. Insects stratified near the water surface in open water areas on all dates except during cool, rainy weather (28 June); on this date, insects were virtually absent from open water. Vertical stratification of insects was less prevalent within and at the edge of stands of emergent vegetation, although most insects were present in the emergent zone near the water surface during inclement weather. ANOVA models from our diel study showed that a significant diel pattern in insect availability existed among zones, but this interaction also depended upon trap-height (chironomid biomass) or date (chironomid counts and biomass). Generally, more insect numbers and biomass were captured in and along stands of emergent macrophytes during the day but chiefly in open water near the surface at night. This diel-zone effect was especially apparent for large chironomids, which were essentially absent during daylight but abundant in open water and edge zones during night. Daytime chironomids were small and predominantly trapped in stands of emergent vegetation. Our results are consistent with previously documented brood foraging behavior and may indicate a trade-off between low energy foraging in the open at night and potentially safer but less productive foraging in stands of emergent vegetation during the day.

AB The percentage of wetlands in a catchment accounted for about half of the variance in transformed data for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in 42 Nova Scotian streams draining catchments with 11 different kinds of vegetation. Color increased with DOG, as did total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). The colar/DOC and DOC/TDN quotients also rose with increasing DOG, indicating a change in the quality of dissolved organic matter with increasing wetland influence. Dissolved Fe, and to a much lesser extent dissolved Al, showed a strong positive correlation with DOG. Stream pH showed a strong negative correlation with DOG, largely from wetlands, and a strong positive correlation with non-marine Ca(2+) weathered from mineral soils. Non-marine SO(4)(2-) from acid deposition had no apparent influence on stream pH and decreased with increasing streamwater DOC in summer, presumably owing to reduction processes in wetlands that mitigated the effects of acid deposition. Apparently, these reduction processes also produced small amounts of dissolved, non-ionic organic sulfur. Non-marine Ca(2+) was related strongly to the percentage of upland hardwood forests in the catchments. Wetlands exert a profound influence on the chemistry of streams, principally through their export of DOC but also because of reduction reactions in their anerobic peats.

AB The relationship between total phosphorus retention, landscape position of wetlands, and surrounding land-use patterns was explored with the goal of identifying easily determined landscape parameters as indicators of a wetland's role in water quality maintenance. Sediment cores were collected from 14 wetland sites chosen to represent a range of wetland types, wetland position, and surrounding land-use patterns in a small coastal Virginia watershed. Sediment accumulation rates and total phosphorus retention rates were analyzed using Cs-137 dating and acid extraction techniques. Both sediment accumulation rates and total phosphorus retention rates were found to be comparable to previously reported values for similar wetland types. The landscape analysis did not support the hypothesis that total phosphorus retention would vary with landscape setting and/or wetland type. The wetlands sampled may represent landscape parameters too similar to detect any significant differences. Alternatively, the findings may indicate that in small coastal watersheds, most wetlands perform total phosphorus retention functions to the same level. The management implications of this latter conclusion may be that headwater wetlands are particularly important for water quality functions.

AB Forested wetlands in the Northern Great Lakes Region are becoming increasingly used as a timber resource. Yet, limited information is available on the effects of harvesting and post-harvest manipulations (site preparation and fertilization) on tree and ground vegetation in these wetland communities. The objective of this study was to examine production changes and species diversity in the vascular plant community four years after a forested, mineral wetland in Northern Michigan was whole-tree harvested, site prepared (bedded or trenched), and fertilized (N, P, N + P). The wetland had an original overstory of black spruce (Picea mariana), tamarack (Larix laricina), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), with a significant cover of Sphagnum and Ericaceous shrubs. Site preparation techniques were done immediately after harvesting. The site was then planted with jack pine seedlings (1-0 stock). Fertilization occurred four years after harvesting and site preparation. Results indicate that trees in bedded areas with N fertilizer applied had significantly greater total seedling height, basal diameter and height increment when compared with those from harvest-only or trenched areas. On harvest-only areas, seedling production was greater with P and N + P fertilizers than with N fertilizer alone. Fertilizer responses were attributed to which type of site preparation (bedding versus trenching) was used and the degree of organic matter and Sphagnum incorporated into the mineral soil. Only site-preparation treatments (not fertilization treatments) had significant effects on numbers and cover of vascular plant groups (woody, herbaceous, and grass/sedge). Number of species and total cover of all vascular plants were significantly greater on the harvest-only areas than on trenched, bedded, or uncut areas. As expected, relative cover of the grass/sedge group increased with increasing site disturbance (bedded and trenched, mainly due to disturbance and lack of the thick Sphagnum mat. When compared to the adjacent uncut area, relative cover of herbaceous species was significantly reduced on treated areas, In future years, if the significant effects of manipulation treatments on tree productivity and vascular plants continue, the resulting community may be different than the successional sequence witnessed by the original forest. This will, however, depend on the rate of crown closure and the invasion of bryophyte species.

DE pollution; nitrogen losses; wetland rice; rice-fish culture
AB Rice is the predominant crop in South and Southeast Asian countries, covering an area of 73.7 million ha. It is unique among the major food crops that, it grows well on flooded soil. When applied under flooded condition nitrogen, a major nutrient is prone to different types of losses, which are as high as 60%. With the increase in area under modern rice varieties in different countries, the usage of chemical fertilizer has been increased up to as high as 150 kg N/ha. About 10% of the total nitrogen fertilizer used globally are applied to rice. Chemical fertilizers supply nitrogen in ammonia, nitrate or amide forms. Among the N-fertilizers, about 80% of the demand are met by urea, which is highly water soluble and prone to losses. When any N compound is applied to a submerged paddy field, it is lost through leaching, denitrification, volatilization and runoff. Of the total N loss, leaching contributes about 30-50%, mostly as nitrate, denitrification, about 10-30% as N-2 and volatilization, about 2-30% as ammonia. The escaped nitrogen causes pollution to the atmosphere and water systems. In the lowlands, a dual rice-fish culture is also practised, where loading of high dose of nitrogen can be lethal to the fish. Studies have shown that nitrogen when applied in the form of ammonium sulfate was more lethal than urea. About 50% of the fish, Catla catla (common carp) were killed when ammonia concentration reached 29.4 mg NH3-N/L. The fish growth was higher under organic based than inorganic based nitrogen fertilizers. The number of phytoplankton species, which are fish food, was also less when chemical fertilizers were used as a nitrogen source. Besides, it is expected that the leached NO3-N may pollute the groundwater. Thus loading of nitrogenous compounds in rice ecosystems creates an unavoidable continuum of environmental hazards in rice growing countries.

ID SEA
AB High concentrations of nitrate in groundwater and surface water make it unsuitable as drinking water. Furthermore, high nitrogen emissions to the marine environment cause eutrophication with increased algal growth, changes in the biological communities and deoxygenation. Both groundwater protection and eutrophication are significant environmental issues on the European agenda. The main source of nitrogen in Europe is agricultural leaching from fields caused by excess inputs of fertilisers and manure compared to harvested output. This is especially evident in North-western Europe. It is reflected in river concentrations of nitrate, which are significantly highest in Western Europe. Since the late 1970s, nitrate concentrations have increased all over Europe reflecting intensification of agriculture. High concentrations occur in groundwater in most parts of Europe and most coastal areas of Europe show signs of eutrophication. In Denmark the Parliament in 1987 decided on the Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment (I), which included measures in several sectors. For agriculture the target was a 49% reduction of nitrogen emissions in order to improve groundwater quality and reduce marine loading. In the early 1990s monitoring results and modelling documented that the measures taken in 1987 as well as additional measures taken were insufficient to reach the target. In late 1997 Action Plan on the Environment (II) was agreed maintaining the target, which shall be reached by a range of measures including restoration of wetlands, afforestation, groundwater protection areas, improved animal fodder utilisation, more stringent requirements on livestock density (harmony criteria), more stringent nitrogen utilisation requirements for animal manure, and reduced nitrogen standards for crops. At the European level, the Nitrates Directive has as objective to reduce nitrate emissions to groundwater and surface water. The fact that no country yet has implemented the Directive, clearly documents the difficulties in taking efficient environmental measures in agriculture. The recent Danish policy measures show that there is no easy and cheap solution, which is also politically acceptable. Therefore a wide range of measures are needed to reduce a significant European environmental problem.

TI Habitat inventory on two Greek wetlands

DT Article
DE wetland habitat; inventory; habitat classification system; spatial
   database; mapping wetland habitats
AB A wetland inventory should constitute an information system that provides a geographically comprehensive picture of acquired information and should give insights into the wetland's temporal dynamics. To achieve this, a proper classification system and a habitat-oriented database are needed. The literature review shows that all wetland inventories at national or European level are site-oriented. For this reason, the Cowardin et al. (1979) classification system was adapted to the conditions prevailing in the Mediterranean region. The method combines remote sensed data with field work to minimize cost and time and results in a wetland-habitat spatial database. Both the adapted classification system and the wetland habitat inventory method were tested successfully at two sites in Greece (Kerkini Lake and the Nestos Delta).

AB Benthic macroinvertebrate communities were sampled bimonthly from December 1993 to April 1995 in three small pondcypress swamps. Eighty-five taxa were collected, with Chironomidae, Dytiscidae, and Hydrophilidae contributing large numbers of genera. Annual mean density was 4,229 individuals/m(2), and monthly densities for individual ponds ranged from 950 to 11,623 individuals/m(2). Three genera, Crangonyx (Amphipoda), Polypedilum, and Chironamus (Chironomidae), accounted for 70% of the total density. High levels of temporal and inter-pond variability were documented. Taxon richness and total density of communities sampled during drawdown were similar to those of wet months. The large number of taxa unique to the dry period contributed substantially to overall taxon richness. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities of these systems seem to be adapted to unpredictable drawdown.

ID SEDIMENT; ARKANSAS; RIVER
AB Characterizing wetland hydrology is key to assessing relative function over a range of wetland types. However, hydrologic data are often lacking. To address this lack of information, we categorized a set of 24 reference wetlands by hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclass from 1993 to 1995, installed monitoring wells and piezometers, and assessed local water-table levels, pH, and specific conductance by month. Four HGM wetland subclasses were common to central Pennsylvania (riparian depression (n = 8), slope (n = 7), mainstem floodplain (n = 5), and headwater floodplain (n = 4)) and formed the basis for our analysis. Median depth to water in the wells differed by HGM subclass. Riparian depressions had the shallowest depth to water (-8 cm) and headwater floodplain wetlands the greatest (-70 cm). Comparisons of the percent occurrence of a piezometric head (from comparisons between paired piezometer and slotted wells) indicated that riparian depressions and slopes had significant ground-water inputs (47 and 48%, respectively), whereas the mainstem floodplain (31%) and headwater floodplain wetlands (23%) were more surface-water-driven systems. Water occurred within the root zone (30 cm) most often for riparian depressions (80% of observations), intermediate for slopes (48%), and least for mainstem floodplains (17%) and headwater floodplains (6%). Headwater floodplain wetlands were never inundated by overbank flow during this study but instead received water from snowmelt and overland flow after rain events. Mainstem floodplain wetlands were inundated by floods during major storm events. The upper 30 cm of soil (i.e., the root zone of plants) was almost continually saturated in riparian depressions, but rarely for both floodplain systems. Slope wetlands were intermediate between riparian depressions and floodplain systems in the amount of time water was present within 30 cm of the ground surface. Riparian depressions and slopes had lower pH than floodplain systems, and pH did not vary significantly by month for any HGM subclass. Floodplain systems (both headwater and mainstem) had greater values of specific conductance than either riparian depressions or slopes; riparian depressions were the only HGM subclass to show seasonality in specific conductance. Factors other than HGM subclass that may have influenced the hydrologic pattern and water quality parameters included bedrock geology, disturbance levels, and watershed attributes.

ID TUPELO SWAMP; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS
AB On the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA, large areas of floodplain swamp forest of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) were destroyed by the cumulative impacts of cooling-water discharges over a 35-year period of nuclear reactor operations. In one floodplain area, four years after thermal discharges ended, we analyzed the pattern of forest recovery across a disturbance gradient spanning from a site of chronic thermal impact and extensive sediment deposition to sites of intermittent thermal impact and little substrate change. Across this spatial gradient, we measured density and size structure of cypress and tupelo and assessed regeneration success in relation to density of surviving canopy trees and to substrate changes. Compared with undisturbed forest, canopy tree density was lower in all disturbed sites and decreased progressively with greater site disturbance. Density of tree regeneration decreased in parallel with declining canopy tree density; however, regeneration was particularly low in the site of chronic impact, where very few canopy trees had survived and where substrates had been modified by sedimentation. Size structures suggested that tree recruitment had occurred synchronously during a 5-year period of regional drought and minimal river flooding. Thus, cypress-tupelo recovery was influenced both by availability of seed sources and by site conditions, but floodplain hydrology also affected regeneration. The pattern of differential recovery across the disturbance gradient has allowed the use of natural regeneration potential in efforts to restore the pre-disturbance forest, and it also illustrates several key factors in wetlands design.

AB We examined the possible effects of mosquito control treatments of wetlands with Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti, applied as Vectobac-G granules) and methoprene (applied as Altosid sand granules) on wetland breeding bird communities. Data collected two years before (1988 and 1990) were compared to data collected three years after (1991-1993) treatments were applied. Total numbers of species and individuals observed remained relatively constant throughout the study period, but several individual species varied annually, most likely due to changes in water levels and habitat available. We found no effect of Bti or methoprene treatments on the bird community or on 19 individual bird species. The few differences that were observed between control and treatment were inconsistent over time and were likely due to chance because of the large number of comparisons that were completed. Despite relatively large reductions of aquatic insects (including mosquitoes) in mid-to late-summer following both treatment types, it is unlikely that food available to bird species in these wetlands was depressed during the breeding season. Effects of weather and predation were probably more important influences on species and community parameters than was mosquito control treatment during the study period. Because of lower aquatic insect densities in mid- to late-summer, other parts of the avian life cycle such as late summer survival, dispersal of young birds, or migrating birds may be more affected by mosquito control treatments.

AB A simple steady state model that is conceptually similar to those of Vollenweider and Dillon was developed to predict phosphorus retention in a wetland treatment system. The proposed model calculates wetland TP outflow concentration (TP(out)) as a function of TP mass loading rate (L), hydraulic loading rate (q(s)), and phosphorus settling velocity (nu(s)). A phosphorus-removal diagram was developed, based on this simple model, and plots L, q(s), nu(s) against TP(out) on a three-axis graph. Comparisons between predicted and observed TP(out) in operating wetlands were in good agreement and indicated that a simple relationship governing phosphorus retention in wetlands exists and this relationship can be used to predict and evaluate wetland treatment performance. The proposed diagram can also be used to answer management questions by manipulating design parameters, such as mass loading and hydraulic loading rate, to evaluate economic impacts due to alternatives such as increasing the size of a wetland surface area, changing water depth, or reducing mass loading rates with pre-treatment options.

ID VEGETATION
AB Hydrologic and soil parameters were surveyed in three wetlands to determine the prevailing influences on vegetation distribution and composition. Five hydrologic parameters, four soil parameters, and the relative elevation of sampling plots in two restored wetlands and one reference wetland were compared. Bray-Curtis ordination techniques were used to discern correlations between the measured environmental parameters and the presence and abundance of twelve wetland plant species. Species' environmental preferences were then related to differences in vegetation distribution and composition between reference and restored wetlands. Data analysis revealed the strongest correlations between average water level, minimum water level, and depth of peat and the presence and abundance of the twelve wetland plant taxa. The relatively thin layer of peat found in the restored areas, and the consequent lower average and minimum water levels, was correlated with the presence and spread of Salix spp. The thicker layer of peat found in the reference area was correlated with the greater presence of the co-dominants Carer aquatilis and Calamagrostis canadensis.

AB The goal of this study was to establish quantitative relationships among vegetation, soil, and ground water that can be used in ecological modeling and engineering. To investigate these relationships, we used data from nature conservation areas in the Netherlands where phreatic ground-water levels had been measured in piezometers for at least five years. The species composition and soil composition of sites near these piezometers were described in detail. The data were used to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of hydrophytes and xerophytes versus average ground-water levels and moisture supply. We found that the distinction between sites dominated by hydrophytes and sites dominated by mesophytes coincides with a mean spring ground-water level of 20-30 cm below surface. Dry sites, dominated by xerophytes, can be defined as sites where under grassland cover moisture deficits will be more than 10 mm in an average year.

AB This paper documents and characterizes a rare form of boreal wetland associated with the nests of whooping cranes, an endangered species. Diatom ponds are found in wetlands in association with bulrush marshes. They are shallow (<50 cm deep) and vary in size from 10 to >1000 m in diameter, may evaporate down to diatom muck by late summer, are strongly influenced by dissolution of gypsum, and are circumneutral to alkaline and high in sulphates. Aquatic macrophytes are few. Pond waters are clear, and the predominant primary producers are a benthic diatom community that gives the ponds a characteristic yellow color (viewed from the air). As the diatom ponds dry, they change color from yellow to pink (when water table is at the surface) to cream (due to a dried diatom and sulphate crust). Diatomaceous earth or sedimentary peat underlies the ponds, which exist in a dynamic relationship with bulrush marshes, wet meadows, fens, and bogs. In the U.S. wetland classification system, diatom ponds fit most nearly within the palustrine, unconsolidated bottom, aquatic bed type. In the Canadian wetland classification system, the diatom ponds might fit in the marsh/shallow open water complex, with a new distinction at the type level. The association between nesting cranes and diatom ponds may be due to a combination of factors such as long sight lines for detection of predators, the proximity of bulrush (their favored nesting material), and use of the ponds for feeding.

ID HABITAT
AB Seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands in eastern South Dakota were surveyed in 1995 and 1996 to identify habitat characteristics influencing wetland use by Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima). Position of a wetland within the landscape and its area were important landscape-scale features influencing wetland use by geese. Our delineation of potential Canada goose habitat using a wetland geographic information system indicated that distribution and area of semi-permanent wetlands likely limit Canada goose occurrence in regions outside the Prairie Coteau. Periodicity in hydrologic cycles within landscapes also may influence goose use of wetlands in eastern South Dakota.

AB The areal distribution of the floating-leaf macrophyte Nelumbo lutea was mapped for 10 of 18 years between 1977 and 1994 in the Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve (OWC), a coastal wetland located in Lake Erie's western basin. The areal extent of N. lutea in the wetland increased from 2.84 hectares (3%) in 1977 to 19.24 hectares (36%) in 1993. Despite an overall increase in the distribution and abundance of N. lutea, individual beds show annual variations in bed coverage and production. Few studies to date have examined the Various factors regulating annual macrophyte population dynamics in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Water-level fluctuations are generally considered the principal factor affecting change in these plant communities; however, we suggest that specific plant growth characteristics such as bed age and reproduction may play a significant role in explaining the observed changes in N. lutea distribution and abundance.

AB This study identified the possible impact of anthropogenic activities on the ecological character of Greek wetlands. The objectives of this project were a) to record the anthropogenic activities that caused change in a wetland's ecological character and assess their intensity for each wetland site and b) to identify the most significant environmental impact on each type of Greek wetland. Nineteen factors of degradation (intensive human activities) were identified and grouped in one of the impact categories according to their most significant direct impact. These degradation factors were grouped into four categories for impact evaluation: change in water regime, depletion of wetland resources, change in water quality, and loss of wetland area.
   To inventory anthropogenic activities and their possible impact on the ecological character of Greek wetlands, more than 1200 questionnaires were distributed, selected, and processed to compile information. These data for 291 wetlands were compiled into a data base GRIN (GReek INventory) that provides information on the factors of degradation of different kinds of wetlands (deltas, estuaries, lagoons, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, marshes, and springs). The following factors most frequently impacted Greek wetlands: a) construction of irrigation schemes and diversion of water courses, causing changes in water regime (12%); b) overpumping, land clearing, and illegal hunting, causing depletion of natural resources (26%); c) agricultural and municipal pollution, causing changes in water quality (54%); and d) establishment of housing facilities and expansion of agriculture, causing loss of wetland area (32%). Change in water regime affected 50% of the springs and 40% of the rivers, natural resources depletion affected 42% of the deltas and 41% of the reservoirs, loss of wetland area affected 60% of the marshes and 52% of the estuaries, while all deltas and 75% of rivers had their water quality impacted.

AB We describe a 9 m(2) drop net and removable walkways designed to quantify densities of small fishes in wetland habitats with low to moderate vegetation density. The method permits the collection of small, quantitative, discrete samples in ecologically sensitive areas by combining rapid net deployment from fixed sites with the carefully contained use of the fish toxicant rotenone. This method requires very little contact with the substrate, causes minimal alteration to the habitat being sampled, samples small fishes in an unbiased manner, and allows for differential sampling of microhabitats within a wetland. When used in dwarf red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) habitat in southern Everglades National Park and adjacent areas (September 1990 to March 1993), we achieved high recovery efficiencies (78-90%) for five common species <110 mm in length. We captured 20,193 individuals of 26 species. The most abundant fishes were sheeps-head minnow Cyprinodon variegatus, goldspotted killifish Floridichthys carpio, rainwater killifish Lucania parva, sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna, and the exotic Mayan cichlid Cichlasoma urophthalmus. The 9 m(2) drop net and associated removable walkways are versatile and can be used in a variety of wetland types, including both interior and coastal wetlands with either herbaceous or woody vegetation.

AB Porewater chemistry and plant height were examined along 5 short transects extending from sections of tidal marsh dominated by the common reed Phragmites australis to these dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Phragmites was found at relatively higher tidal elevations along 4 of 5 transects; along all transects, Phragmites was growing and flowering throughout a porewater salinity range from 12 to 30 ppt. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations varied from 0 to >35 mu M in both Spartina and Phragmites sections of marsh, but ammonium concentrations averaged >40 mu M in zones dominated by Spartina and <10 mu M in zone's dominated by Phragmites. Phragmites shoots were shorter in marsh soils where sulfide concentrations were >400 mu M, perhaps due to sulfide inhibition of nitrogen uptake for growth. The persistence of Phragmites at field conditions of high salinity and elevated sulfide concentrations suggests that hydrologic management may be insufficient to eradicate Phragmites in tidal wetlands.

ID DESIGN
AB Constructed wetlands are gaining increased attention for treatment of nonpoint source pollution. Although constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment in warm climates, their performance in cold climates has been questioned. A surface-how wetland, designed to treat 2.65 m(3) d(-1) of milkhouse wastewater, was constructed on the University of Connecticut's Storrs campus in 1994. The purpose of the project was to determine the efficiency of the system to reduce nutrients, five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), bacteria, and total suspended solids and to reduce fecal coliform bacteria. During the first ten months of operation, outflow volume was 90% of inflow. Although the wetland was designed to process a BOD5 loading rate of 1500 mg/L, the average actual loading rate was 3000 mg/L. The overall percent mass retention of total suspended solids was 45% and for nutrients was 28%, 27%, 47%, and 6%, for total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl-N, nitrate-N, and ammonia-N, respectively. The percent reduction of fecal coli form and BOD5 was 31% and 28% respectively. Mass retention was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during the growing season than during plant senescence for total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl, ammonia, and nitrate/nitrite nitrogen. Effluent ammonia nitrogen concentrations often exceeded influent values during the winter. Preliminary indications are that the treatment of the wastewater does not meet design standards, especially in the winter, probably due to overloading of BOD5.

AB Limesink wetlands are a common aquatic habitat in southwest Georgia, USA. These wetlands are non-alluvial, occupying shallow depressions formed from dissolution of limestone bedrock and collapse of surface sands. They are seasonally inundated, with a typical hydroperiod extending from late February to early July. Little is known about factors influencing invertebrate community structure in limesink wetlands. Recently, it has been suggested that regular inundation and drying are important influences on community structure in some seasonal wetlands. We had an opportunity to examine this hypothesis in 3 forested limesink wetlands. Quantitative samples of invertebrates were taken monthly on benthic and wood surfaces from March 1994 through July 1995. This included a period of unusually heavy precipitation, summer and autumn of 1994, when the wetlands would normally be dry. Immediately following inundation, benthic samples were dominated by amphipods (Crangonyx sp.), isopods (Caecidotea sp.), cladocerans, and copepods. Maximum total densities (1000-4000 individuals per m(2)) were observed within 3 months of inundation. During summer and autumn, densities decreased (< 500 individuals per m(2)), and the benthos was dominated by larval chironomids. Wood surfaces were dominated by chironomids, with greatest densities (1000-3000 individuals per m(2)) observed in summer and autumn. Although not quantified, freshwater sponge became very abundant on wood surfaces during autumn. During the following spring (1995), invertebrate densities on sediments remained low, and few amphipods, isopods, cladocerans, or copepods were collected. Chironomids remained very abundant on wood. Our results suggest that extended inundation is a disturbance to some elements of wetland invertebrate communities. Extended inundation may cause short-term reductions in populations by eliminating summer refugia (amphipoda, isopoda) or by altering environmental cues necessary for the completion of life cycles (cladocerans, copepods).

AB I examined differences in the biogeochemical cycles of CH4 and CO2 (fluxes, concentrations, production, CH4 oxidation) in Typha latifolia wetlands on silty clay sediment versus organic peat soil in central New York State to determine whether variation in the amount of organic matter in sediment or soil, or plant production on sites with different organic matter content, affected variation in CH4 and CO2. I found very high temporal variation in CH4 within each site, precluding the detection of variation in CH4 as a function of sediment or soil organic matter content. In 1994, CH4 efflux from two peat sites to the atmosphere averaged 7 and 87 nmol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 89 and 408 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for two sediment sites. Mean CO2 efflux from the peat sites was 0.40 and 1.51 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 1.02 and 1.65 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the sediment sites. I assessed the role of plant production by experimentally removing T. latifolia shoots from small plots: this lowered CH4 efflux from the sediment site by 85%, suggesting that plants foster CH4 production in low organic matter sediment, but CH4 efflux was 14-times greater following shoot removal on one peat site. Shoot removal had no effect on CO2 efflux. Variations in temperature, dissolved organic carbon, and pCH(4) in sediment or soil porewater explained the variation in CH4 efflux among the four study sites, whereas variation in net primary production explained the variation in CO2 efflux.

AB The ecologies of waterbirds are closely tied to the distribution and abundance of food resources. For many species of waterfowl and shorebirds, benthic invertebrates (especially Chironomidae) are an important dietary component that influences habitat selection. Consequently, we sampled benthic invertebrates and measured water depth at foraging locations of nine waterbird species and paired random sites in the Grasslands of the northern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA from January to April 1994 and 1995. Our resulting habitat-selection models indicate significant differences in benthic invertebrate densities or biomasses at foraging and random locations for three of nine species and significant differences in water depths between foraging and random locations for four of nine species. Additionally, we observed significant interspecific differences in water depths at foraging locations-shorebirds used shallow habitats (<10 cm), whereas most waterfowl species foraged in deep water (>20 cm). Waterfowl foraged over a wider range of water depths than shorebirds, indicating greater behavioral flexibility in habitat use. Our results indicate that selection of foraging habitat by smaller bodied waterbirds, including dowitchers, dunlin, western sandpiper, and least sandpiper is strongly influenced by water depth, which mediates the availability of benthic invertebrates. Additionally, foraging site selection of more mobile taxa that are able to forage in a wide range of water depths, including northern shoveler and american green-winged teal, is influenced by invertebrate biomass. The broad range of water depths used by waterfowl and the relatively restricted depths used by shorebirds indicate that water depth can be manipulated to benefit a multitude of waterbird species.

AB Restoration of drained wetlands requires the re-establishment of a native wetland plant community. This can be difficult in areas where long-term drainage has eliminated wetland vegetation and significantly reduced the number of viable wetland plant seeds in the seed bank. This study of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wetland restoration sites in northern New York examines the effectiveness of transplanting wetland soil from small remnant wetlands in the drainage ditches to the area that becomes shallow marsh following reflooding. The results of two experiments are reported, including a small-scale study of transplantation techniques using small plots with treatments and controls established by hand, and a large-scale application of soil transplantation and site-preparation techniques using heavy equipment to establish large plots across entire wetland basins. In the small-scale study, the transplant plots had significantly lower wetland index values, indicating greater dominance of wetland plants, after one growing season but not after two. Transplant plots also had more wetland plant species and more wetland plant cover than natural control plots, and these differences persisted through the second growing season. Litter removal and soil disturbance also lowered the wetland index values and increased wetland plant species number and cover, but only for the first growing season. In the large-scale study, soil transplantation significantly increased both the number of species and the amount of cover of wetland plants and of plants valuable as wildlife food sources. Mowing and plowing treatments increased wetland plant establishment, but much less than soil transplantation, and plowing significantly increased the establishment of cattail (Typha spp.), an undesirable invasive species in small wildlife marshes. Soil transplantation should be a particularly effective technique for improving wetland plant establishment and limiting cattail encroachment in areas disturbed by dike construction.

AB The quantitative contribution of benthic (periphytic) and planktonic algae to primary production in prairie wetlands is largely unknown, as is their response to the fluctuations in water level that characterize such systems. We measured the biomass (chlorophyll-a m(-2) of wetland area) of phytoplankton, epipelon, epiphyton, and metaphyton in Delta Marsh, Manitoba as part of a five-year study in which diked, drawn down cells were reflooded to the normal level of the wetland, or to a depth 30 cm or 60 cm deeper. Our objective was to investigate the effects of flooding depth on algal biomass and the relative contributions by each of the four algal assemblages. Floating metaphyton mars flourished in all cells after flooding, contributing about 87% of total algal biomass. Epiphytes contributed 11% of biomass, and epipelon and phytoplankton each contributed 1%. Emergent macrophyte density was reduced by flooding, leading to increases in open water area. The wetland cells changed gradually over the study period from an early ''open wetland'' to a ''sheltered wetland.'' In late stages of the study, phytoplankton became more abundant as the cells proceeded to a ''lake wetland'' state.
