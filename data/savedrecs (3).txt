AB There have been few measurements of primary productivity by benthic (periphytic) and planktonic algae in prairie wetlands so their quantitative importance relative to other primary producers is largely unknown, We measured the daily productivity (inorganic carbon assimilation per m(2) of wetland area) of phytoplankton, epipelon, epiphyton, and metaphyton in ten wetland cells in Delta Marsh, Manitoba over a five-year period, Water levels in the cells were manipulated so that some cells had normal water levels for the wetland, while water depths increased 30 cm or 60 cm in other treatments. With increasing water depth, phytoplankton productivity increased while that of epipelon, epiphyton, and metaphyton decreased. Metaphyton was the largest contributor to total algal productivity (70%), followed by epiphyton (23%), phytoplankton (6%), and epipelon (1%). Phytoplankton had the highest photosynthetic efficiency (C assimilated per unit chlorophyll), despite being a minor contributor to Coral productivity. Variations in P-I parameters (alpha, beta, I-k, and P-max) were considerable, possibly due to temporal and spatial fluctuation in the abiotic environment. Algal productivity was comparable to that of submersed and emergent macrophytes, suggesting that algae are probably important resources in supporting food webs in prairie wetlands.

AB This study demonstrates an approach for rapidly collecting quantitative field data on reference wetland sites and using those data to assess functions (ecological processes) in wetlands. We demonstrate the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) assessment procedure by identifying ecological functions performed by mineral soil wet flats, obtaining quantitative field data from 19 wet Bats (reference sites) in southeastern North Carolina, and modeling wetland functions using variables derived from those field data. We chose a subset of the 19 reference sites to demonstrate how HGM assessment can be used to measure ecosystem functions before and after a project site is altered and the degree to which ecosystem restoration can compensate for a reduction in functions caused by a project's impact.
   We also illustrate how HGM assessment can be used to determine the minimum area over which restoration should be applied to achieve a no-net-loss in function objective. This minimum area can be determined by dividing the degree to which a function is reduced through project alteration by the degree to which a function is increased through restoration. The ratio of wetland area restored to wetland area altered by a project impact (compensatory mitigation ratio) varies among functions and is influenced by (1) the magnitude to which any given function occurs at a project site both before and after the site is altered, (2) the magnitude to which any given function occurs at a compensatory mitigation site both before and after restoration is applied, and (3) the rate at which any given function is restored.

   Washington; wetland birds; wetland excavation; wetland vegetation
ID MARSH; RESPONSES; BIOMASS
AB Despite having an arid climate, the Columbia River Basin of eastern Washington is one of the most important areas for breeding, migrating, and wintering wetland birds in the Pacific Northwest. Extensive farmland irrigation near the O'Sullivan Reservoir and other areas has raised water tables, resulting in closed canopies of emergent vegetation in what are now permanent, shallow wetlands. During 1994-95, we found that avian communities on vegetation-filled wetlands excavated to create open water had greater mean densities of dabbling and diving ducks (Anatidae), shorebirds, American coots (Fulica americana), and terns (Sterna spp.) than untreated control wetlands. Densities of yellow-beaded blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) were greater on excavated wetlands. while the densities of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), Sera (Porzana carolina), and Virginia rails (Rallus limicola) were greater on unaltered sites. Densities of marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) and other passerines were similar among excavated and control wetlands. Zooplankton biomass was greater on altered wetlands and generally greater in older excavations. We suggest that managers may design constructed wetland basins to improve population management of diverse wetland bird species by creating an appropriate mix of wetland habitats at the landscape level.

AB Seed-bank samples were collected in the northern Everglades along a phosphorus gradient with three vegetation zones (cattail with the highest phosphorus levels, mixed cattail-sawgrass (transition), and sawgrass with the lowest phosphorus levels). The size and composition of the seed banks were estimated using both a direct seed separation (seed assay) and a seedling emergence technique (seedling assay). In the seedling assay, seed-bank samples were kept under two moisture regimes, saturated soil and shallowly flooded. In the seed assay, whole seed of 21 species were found, with a mean of about 8 species per sample in the cattail zone and about 5 in the transition and sawgrass zones. On the basis of their appearance, seeds of 18 species were judged to be intact, that is, probably viable. There were about 7 species per sample with intact seed in the cattail zone, and 3 and 4 in the transition and sawgrass zones, respectively. In the seedling assay, seedlings of only II species were found. All II were found in the saturated soil treatment, and 7 were also found in the shallowly flooded treatment. in the seed assay, the mean total number of whole and intact seeds in the cattail zone was estimated to be 78,400 and 44,400 seeds m(-2), respectively. The mean total number of whole and intact seeds in the transition zone was much lower, 14,200 and 10,500 seeds m(-2) respectively, and in the sawgrass zone, it was slightly higher at 20,900 and 14,700 seeds m(-2), respectively. In the seedling assay, seed densities were much lower and were estimated to be only 3,700, 800, and 1,300 seeds m(-2), respectively, in the cattail, transition, and sawgrass zones. The seedling assay results suggest that only about 1.3% of the intact seed had germinated. Overall, the composition of the seed banks of the transition and sawgrass zones were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly different from that of the cattail zone. Seeds of several species were restricted primarily or exclusively to cattail-dominated areas, including seeds of Typha sp.

AB The effect of rhizosphere oxidation on redox level was investigated between vegetated and denuded plots and between Acer rubrum and Fraxirtus pennsylvanica seedlings within a seasonally flooded forested system in Virginia. Redox potentials were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the upper 15 cm of the soils in the vegetated plots. Redox potential within the root mass of Acer rubrum seedlings did not differ significantly from those adjacent to the root mass. Fraxinus pennsylvanica seedlings showed significantly (p < 0.01) elevated redox potential within the root mass when compared to the adjacent nonrooted area. Vegetation directly influences the redox state of the rhizosphere in seasonally flooded forested systems through seasonal growth patterns and adventitious root formation. This may have implications in the biogeochemical cycling of soil constituents in forested wetland systems and subsequent water quality functions.

AB Wetlands represent a substantial part of Manitoba's terrestrial landscape, covering 233,340 km(2) or 43% of the province; peatlands represent 90% of all wetlands. A wetland inventory for Manitoba is presented following a classification scheme grounded in wetland function, vegetation, and landform. The province is subdivided into twelve wetland regions each having distinctive wetland types and abundances. A hybrid Detrended Canonical Correspondance Analysis (DCCA) indicates that wetland distribution in the province is largely controlled by allogenic factors of climate and physiography. The first canonical axis represents the variance in wetland distribution occurring along a north-to-south gradient within the province. In northern Manitoba, permafrost bogs dominate, replaced southwards by bogs without permafrost and fens with and without internal lawns. Farther south, peatlands are replaced by non-peat-accumulating wetlands. This wetland distributional gradient is most strongly correlated to mean annual temperature, with thermal seasonal aridity, annual precipitation, and moisture deficit (precipitation-potential evaporation) also significant. Significant allogenic variables correlated to the first canonical axis are not restricted to climate alone. The type of bedrock geology in the area also plays an important role in determining wetland distribution, with bogs occurring preferentially in areas of acidic bedrock, while fens are found on calcareous bedrock. The second canonical axis represents a surface-water flow gradient, with patterned fens and marshes having relatively large amounts of surface-water flow on one end and nonpermafrost bogs and swamps with low amounts of surface-water flow on the other. Texture of the subsurface is the most important variable explaining the second axis, with sediments having high hydraulic conductivity correlated to wetlands with high surface-water flow, while sediments with low hydraulic conductivity are related to wetlands with low surface-water how. Annual precipitation is also a statistically significant variable explaining the variance in wetland distribution along the second axis.

AB Sedimentation on the surface of tidal marshes is a process that is controlled by the interactions of a complex set of variables. To adequately describe the patterns of sediment transport and deposition in any particular system requires extensive sampling of biological, physical, sedimentological, and geomorphological parameters. In this study, measurements of sediment deposition, marsh elevation, water level, total suspended solid (TSS) loads, overmarsh current speeds, and vegetative cover were used to determine which of these factors control sediment distribution patterns in a small marsh basin in southeastern North Carolina. The results of this study suggest that marsh elevation exerted significant control over deposition but that its effects were largely muted by other processes. Creek hydrology, sediment instability associated with areas of new creek development, plant/flow interactions, and tidal creek TSS concentrations also influenced sediment deposition in the study area. Flow patterns, resulting from the interaction between tidal stage and marsh topography, controlled the dispersal of particulate matter across the marsh surface and contributed to significant depositional differences among sampling sites as a function of tidal stage. The results of this study indicate that tidal creek geometry, creek channel position, and tidal stage interact synergistically to control sediment/particulate delivery on the surfaces of tidal wetlands.

ID ECOLOGICAL FIELD EXPERIMENTS; DESIGN
AB The structure of a priori-defined aquatic habitats was compared within the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which comprises the northern remnant of the Everglades ecosystem. Total plant biomass, canopy height, water depth, and the relative abundance (percent cover) of plant species in adjacent sloughs (including alligator holes), wet prairies, and sawgrass stands were compared over a 30-month period. These habitats formed a mosaic of aquatic habitats of differing structure and plant community composition. Slough and alligator hole habitats were in deeper water with little or no canopy, and habitat structure was provided almost entirely by submersed bladderwort (Utricularia) and floating water lily (Nymphaea). Sawgrass stands were present in shallower water and had a well-developed canopy that was generated almost entirely by Cladium. Wet prairies were intermediate in water depth and canopy stature, with emergent sedges (i.e., Eleocharis, Rhynchospora) providing most habitat structure. Differences among adjacent habitats accounted for most of the observed variation in habitat structure and plant relative abundance, whereas differences among widely-separated areas in the Refuge (i.e., landscape-level differences) accounted for little of the observed variation. In contrast, water depth varied considerably among sampling areas, likely reflecting hydrologic gradients that occur across the Refuge landscape. Similarly, although differences among sampling months were minimal for most habitat features examined, most of the variation observed in water depth was accounted for by sampling month, as would be expected in a seasonally dynamic wetland such as the Everglades. Discriminant function analyses using plant relative abundance data, habitat structure data, or both sets of data combined correctly classified most sites with respect to a priori-defined habitat type, despite similarities in plant community composition in sloughs and wet prairies. Overall, it appears that sloughs, wet prairies, and sawgrass stands are distinct with respect to habitat structure and plant community composition and that differences among these habitats are persistent across the Refuge landscape.

TI Marsh development after large floods in an alluvial, arid-land river

AB Large expanses of riverine marsh are rare in the desert Southwest, given the dry surface of many floodplain soils. Along the Hassayampa River, riverine marsh underwent a 5-fold increase (from 2% to 9% of the floodplain-channel area) after a large winter flood in 1993. Flood waters eroded terraces that had aggraded during frequent, smaller floods, widened the channel from about 3 to 50 m, and recharged the floodplain aquifer. The net effect of these changes was a lowering of the floodplain surface relative to the water table, a variable of critical importance to riparian plant composition in arid-land rivers. Olney's bulrush (Scirpus americanus Pers.), southern cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.), jointed rush (Juncus articulatus L.), and other obligate wetland species were abundant in 1993 and 1994 on areas with saturated surface soils or shallow water tables and often were intermixed with seedlings of early-seral tree species, including Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii S. Watson), Goodding willow (Salix gooddingii Ball), and salt cedar (Tamarix chinensis Loureiro and related species). The gain in riverine marsh and young cottonwood-willow stands occurred at the expense of mature cottonwood-willow forests and deep-rooted, velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina Woot.) woodlands, Another large flood in 1995 scoured the channel of most existing vegetation and aggraded the 1993 flood channel, Early-seral tree species again established in moist soils exposed by the slowly receding flood waters, However, redevelopment of extensive marsh habitat was precluded by sediment deposition that increased the elevation of the floodplain surface relative to the water table. These changes highlight the transitory nature of riverine marsh and other vegetation patch types in the dynamic floodplains of alluvial, arid-land rivers and underscore the importance of maintaining: flood flows of varying magnitude to maintain patch type diversity.

SO WETLANDS

DT Article

   delineation
ID SOILS
AB Methods for wetland identification and delineation require the investigator to determine whether vegetation is hydrophytic. Two widely used techniques for making hydrophytic vegetation decisions involve dominance ratios (i.e., the percentage of dominant species that are rated obligate (OBL), facultative wetland (FACW), and facultative (FAG)) and prevalence indices (i.e., the weighted-average wetland indicator status of all plants present). We sampled 338 vegetation plots on sites throughout the United States and calculated the dominance ratio and a plot-based prevalence index for each plot. We found that hydrophytic vegetation decisions based on the two methods disagreed on 16% of field plots. Analysis of simulated plot data (n = 80,000) indicated that frequencies of disagreement increase as vegetation complexity (i.e., number of strata and number of species per stratum) increases. We conclude that the two methods for hydrophytic vegetation decisions disagree too often to be considered equivalent. Additional studies are needed in different biogeographic regions and plant community types to determine the conditions under which prevalence indices, dominance ratios, or some other treatment of vegetation data provide more reliable indicators of wetland vegetation.

AB Growth and physiological responses of 15 open-pollinated families of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) subjected to flooding with saline water were evaluated in this study. Ten of the families were from coastal sites in Louisiana and Alabama, USA that have elevated levels of soil-water salinity. The other five families were from inland, freshwater sites in Louisiana. Seedlings from all families tolerated flooding with water of low (2 g l(-1)) salinity. Differences in biomass among families became most apparent at the highest: salinity levels (6 and 8 g l(-1)), Overall, increasing salinity reduced leaf biomass more than root biomass, which in turn was reduced more than stem biomass. A subset of seedlings from the main greenhouse experiment was periodically placed indoors under artificial light, and measurements were made of gas exchange and leaf water potential, Also, tissue concentrations of Cl-, Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were determined at the end of the greenhouse experiment. Significant intraspecific variation was found for nearly all the physiological parameters evaluated, but only leaf concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were correlated with an index of family-level differences in salt tolerance.

ID VEGETATION
AB Linear wetlands that occupy the valley bottoms in the Canadian Arctic Islands represent distinct ecological niches in the polar desert environment, but the hydrologic processes associated with such wetlands are poorly known. One such wetland, the Muskox Fen (area 3700 m(2)) in central Ellesmere Island, N.W.T., was studied during a relatively dry year (1993). Hydrologic processes were most active in the spring, with snowmelt providing most of the water supply to the fen. Water storage capacity was satisfied easily, guaranteeing wetland saturation despite a low snowfall winter. At this time, the wetland was a poor regulator of runoff, the valley bottom served merely as a conduit for the basin meltwater to pass through. During the dry period in summer, the wetland received little lateral inflow from its catchment, and vertical processes of rainfall and evaporation prevailed while the water storage gradually decreased. In the wet period, saturation was restored after only moderate rainfall. For most parts of the summer, a high water table was maintained because permafrost impeded deep seepage loss, thus preventing excessive drying of the wetland vegetation.

AB Nyssa aquatica and Taxodium distichum seedlings were grown for four months in sand amended with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10% fly ash (by weight). Leaf boron concentrations were linearly related to Ay ash addition up to the 5% treatment but did not increase in the 10% treatment. Taxodium distichum growth was not adversely affected by By asb addition. However, N. aquatica biomass, basal diameter, and height were reduced 75, 50, and 50%, respectively, al the two highest Ay ash rates. By differentially affecting the growth and vigor of seedlings of these two dominant woody species, regeneration of N. aquatica would be much less successful than T. distichum in wetlands containing fly ash.

AB Particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen (PN), particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations, and stable carbon isotope compositions (delta(13)C) are reported for Moji-Guacu River (suspended matter) and Infernao Lake (suspended matter and bottom sediment) samples collected during the entire 1990/91 hydrologic year. POC and PN concentrations for both systems and riverine PP concentrations peaked during the wet season, but only riverine PP concentrations peaked together with the river discharge, thus characterizing the regional watershed (main river) as the principal source of this phosphorus. Lacustrine POC, PN, and PP displayed maximum concentrations before discharge peak, suggesting that local sources (lake basin, wetlands, and internal production) are more important in the lake case. A less pronounced increase in riverine PN than in POC or PP increments also was documented, possibly due to denitrification occurring in the river-wetland system. The principal source of organic matter in the Moji-Guacu River is watershed inputs. The origin of suspended matter in the oxbow lake is mainly phytoplankton, while bottom sediments are composed by a more refractory fraction of organic matter derived from local runoff, lake macrophytes, and riverine POM, with some contribution of lake POM subjected to alteration by early diagenetic processes.

ID WATER-BALANCE; LAKES; SWAMP
AB Two sets of hydrologic indices were developed to characterize the water-budget components of nontidal wetlands. The first set consisted of six water-budget indices for input and output variables, and the second set consisted of two hydrologic interaction indices derived from the water-budget indices. The indices then were applied to 19 wetlands with previously published water-budget data. Two trilinear diagrams for each wetland were constructed, one for the three input indices and another for the three output indices. These two trilinear diagrams then were combined with a central quadrangle to form a Piper-type diagram, with data points from the trilinear diagrams projected onto the quadrangle. The quadrangle then was divided into nine fields that summarized the water-budget information. Two quantitative ''interaction indices'' were calculated from two of the six water-budget indices (precipitation and evapotranspiration). They also were obtained graphically from the water-budget indices, which were first projected to the central quadrangle of a Piper-type diagram from the flanking trilinear plots. The first interaction index (I) defines the strength of interaction between a wetland and the surrounding ground- and surface-water system. The second interaction index (S) defines the nature of the interaction between the wetland and the surrounding ground- and surface-water system (source versus sink). Evaluation of these indices using published wetland water-budget data illustrates the usefulness of the technique.

TI Fish communities in a diked Lake Erie wetland and an adjacent undiked
   area
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE fish communities; wetlands; Lake Erie; management; diked wetlands
ID MACROPHYTES; VEGETATION; TURBIDITY; DIVERSITY
AB Most (84%) of Ohio's remaining Lake Erie wetlands are diked to maximize food production and habitat for migrating waterfowl. Typically these wetlands are partially drained during spring and refilled the following fall. Fish populations have not been managed extensively, probably because few quantitative data are available on fish communities in diked wetlands and on how water-level manipulations affect these communities. We used trap nets to sample fish monthly (April-August) in diked West Marsh and in the formerly diked Muddy Creek Bay. We compared fish communities on the basis of species richness, composition, and equitability; relative abundance; and mean length and body condition of species common to both areas. We collected 23 species from the diked area and 40 species from the undiked area. Although there were more species collected in the undiked area, species equitability was greater in the diked wetland. The five most abundant species in the diked wetland were white crappie Pomoxis annularis, brown bullhead Amieurus nebulosus, black bullhead A. melas, goldfish Carassius auratus, and common carp Cyprinis carpio. The dominant species in the undiked area were white perch Morone americana, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, white crappie, brown bullhead, and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Neither area contained a classical, diverse wetland fish community. Mean lengths of white crappie, common carp, goldfish, and brown bullhead were significantly greater from the undiked area during all months. Body condition indices of > 150 mm white crappies and > 225 mm brown bullheads were significantly greater in the undiked area after June. The large differences in length and condition indices indicate that fish communities in the diked wetland may be biologically isolated from those in the adjacent undiked area. This has management implications given that an almost complete exchange of water occurs annually and could result in extensive movement of fish in and out of the diked wetland. Management strategies compatible with or enhancing existing wildlife management strategies need to be developed for improving fish communities in diked wetlands and enhancing their contribution to Lake Erie.

ID MANAGEMENT; EVERGLADES; USA
AB The pattern of water-level fluctuations in a wetland is its hydroperiod. Characterization of this pattern cannot be accomplished by measuring a single parameter, but some means of measuring hydroperiod is needed so that comparisons can be made both between wetlands and within a single wetland over time. Harmonic analysis can be used to characterize hydroperiod quantitatively by obtaining the amplitude and timing of the dominant periodic component in a time series of water levels. The utility of this method is demonstrated by investigating the link between water management in South Florida and nesting failure by wood storks in the Everglades wetland. With the quantitative measures of hydroperiod derived by harmonic analysis, I am able to demonstrate statistically the relationships between water management and hydroperiod in the Everglades and between hydroperiod and the probability of nesting failure. The simplicity and directness by which these results are achieved suggests the potential for harmonic analysis of hydroperiod as a general tool for wetland science.

ID SEED BANKS; COMMUNITY
AB To evaluate the efficiency of different methods of wetland plant establishment and different soil amendments, 16 experimental plots in 4 treatment groups were established at a 6-ha created palustrine wetland in Tipton, PA. Response of vegetation, soil, and hydrology were evaluated. The first objective of the study was to determine if salvaged marsh surface (SMS) from a donor wetland can be used to effectivly vegetate experimental plots. The results were compared with control plots. In addition, the possibility of using a non-toxic organic waste (leaf litter compost) as a soil amendment to created wetland projects was examined. Lurid sedge (Carer lurida) tubers were hand-planted in the leaf litter plots and in the existing mineral soils of the remaining experimental plots. SMS plots had significantly greater plant species richness, total vegetative coverage, and diversity than control plots. SMS plots contained more hydrophytic vegetation and less undesirable vegetation than control plots. SMS added significant amounts of organic matter and soil nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) to the soils in treated plots. Survivorship of hand-planted Carer was greater (79.0 +/- 5.0 % for both July and August 1992) on plots treated with leaf litter compost than on plots with existing mineral soils (45.0 +/- 20.0% in July and 38.0 +/- 20.0 % in August 1992). Organic matter, pH, total N, and NO, levels were all significantly greater on leaf litter plots than on hand-planted plots after the 1991 growing season. At the end of the 1992 growing season, organic matter, pH, NO3, and NH4 levels were significantly greater on leaf litter plots than on hand-planted plots. The results of the study suggest that SMS can be used as a method to successfully revegetate created wetlands. Also, the addition of leaf litter compost to experimental plots helped to retain soil moisture and provide nutrients that enhanced survivorship of hand-planted Carex.

AB We examined the responses of invertebrates and plants important in waterfowl diets to two management methods (prescribed burning and mowing) commonly used in seasonal wetlands. Experimental plots were constructed in summer 1992 in stands of saltgrass (Distichlis spicata); 50% of the vegetation was removed in treatment areas (10 m x 10 m) by either burning or mowing. After the plots were flooded, we sampled aquatic invertebrates monthly from November 1992 through February 1993. In August 1993, we sampled plants that grew in areas that had been burned or mowed. Burning and mowing treatments had very different results. Many numerically dominant macroinvertebrates and microinvertebrates had higher densities in burned treatment areas than in unmanipulated control areas, but densities of most taxa were not different in mowed treatment areas and control areas. Copepod densities were lower in burned treatment areas and oligochaete densities were lower in mowed treatment areas than in control areas. Midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) biomass was higher in burned and mowed treatment areas than in control areas. Plant species richness and percent cover of some plant taxa were higher in burned areas than in control areas. Many of the invertebrates and plants we sampled are important in waterfowl diets, and our results indicate that these methods can enhance waterfowl food resources.

AB We investigated the effect of decomposing duck carcasses on aquatic invertebrate numbers, biomass, and taxonomic composition in a seasonally flooded, impounded wetland in the Sacramento Valley, California during August-November 1988 and 1989. Major invertebrate taxa were copepods (Cyclopoida, occurred in 8.3% of samples), water fleas (Daphnidae, 8.9%), water boatmen (Corisella, 10.4%), and midge larvae (Goeldichironomus, 9.3%; Chironomus, 11.5%; Tanypus, 17.2%). We found no treatment (carcass present or no carcass) by sampling day interaction for these taxa. We found a significant difference between sample plots with carcasses and those without carcasses only for Daphnidae counts and Corisella wet weights. We found significant differences among sampling days for these taxa that were probably statistical artifacts. We were unable to detect any effect of duck carcasses on aquatic invertebrate community structure and the potential availability of invertebrates as waterfowl food.

AB Mercury-resistant bacteria belonging to the genera Bacillus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Sarcina, Shigella, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were isolated from gills and guts of fresh water fish collected from wetland fisheries around Calcutta, India, contaminated with mercury compounds. The total number of bacteria, as well as Hg-resistant bacteria, were always higher in guts than gills. Bottom-dwelling fish contained higher number of bacteria, including Hg-resistant bacteria, than surface and middle water dwelling fish. They belonged either to narrow-spectrum or to broad-spectrum Hg-resistant groups and they also possessed other heavy metal and antibiotic resistant properties. In the presence of toxic levels of HgCl2, phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) and methylmercuric chloride (MMC), the lag in growth of the bacterial strains gradually increased with increasing concentration of Hg-compounds. Narrow-spectrum Hg-resistant bacterial strains volatilized only HgCl2 from the liquid medium in the range of 64-89%, whereas the broad-spectrum group exhibited a high level of HgCl2 (80-94%), PMA (72-84%) and MMC (64-80%) volatilizing capacity with inducible mercuric reductase and organomercurial lyase enzyme activities in their cell-free extracts. Cell-free extracts prepared from narrow-spectrum Hg-resistant bacterial strains induced by HgCl2 exhibited Hg+2-dependent NADPH oxidation, indicating the presence of only mercuric reductase enzyme.

AB The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impact of rhizosphere/burrow oxidation by wetland plants and burrowing invertebrates on the biogeochemistry of metals and metalloids in salt marsh ecosystems. It was hypothesised that salt marsh plants and burrowing invertebrates could considerably affect the retention capacity of wetlands for metals through oxidation of the rhizosphere/burrow wall.
   Various soil, plant and porewater samples were collected from areas dominated by the plant species Spartina townsendii and Atriplex portulacoides and by the lugworm Arenicola marina, and from corresponding nearby unvegetated/uninhabited sites at North Bull Island salt marsh, Dublin Bay, Ireland. Samples were analysed for total Fe, Zn and As. The organic matter content (LOT), bulk density, water content and dry/fresh weight ratio of rhizosphere, burrow wall and bulk soil was measured for each species. DCB-extractable Fe, Zn and As, associated with the iron plaque on the roots of the two plant species were also determined.
   The presence of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, burrowing organisms were shown to have a significant effect on the concentration and accumulation of heavy metals in salt marsh soils. Iron and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher in vegetated/inhabited sails compared to nearby unvegetated/uninhabited areas. Zinc showed the same trend but the difference was not statistically significant. The concentrations of Fe and As were also significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil around the plant roots and in the burrow walls of Arenicola compared to the bulk soil. For zinc, the same pattern was significant only for S. townsendii-dominated soils. Atriplex stands appeared to have the greatest potential for heavy metal accumulation with concentrations reaching 1238 mu mol Fe g(-1), 4.9 mu mol Zn g(-1) and 512 nmol As g(-1) in the rhizosphere. The Zn/Fe ratio for S. townsendii and the As/Fe ratios for both plant species also increased from the bulk soil towards the roots. Concentrations of Zn and As appeared to correlate with both Fe concentrations and LOI values. However, covariation was significant only with Fe, indicating that it is the oxidation of Fe, rather than the binding to organic matter, that drives the accumulation of Zn and As. The amount of each element present in the various compartments associated with the plants (the sum of the element concentrations in the rhizosphere, ironplaque and roots) in I litre of the top 20 cm of soil, amounted to 0.84% for Fe, 3.6% for Zn and 2.8% for As for S. townsendii, and 12.5% for Fe, 19% for Zn and 18.3% for As for A. portulacoides. Densities of A. marina were never higher than 1 per litre of top sail so the small volume of burrow wall soil would therefore render that pool of negligible size compared to the rhizospheres of plants. It is likely that lugworms affect the movement of metals more importantly through bioturbation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Ca, P, Al, and trace metal (Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb) concentrations were measured in several aquatic invertebrate taxa used as food by breeding insectivorous waterfowl, sampled fi om three sites in eastern Canada with widely varying water chemistry. Ca concentrations were highest in molluscs (snails and clams), averaging 200-300 mg g(-1) (shells included). Aquatic insects of varying sizes, life stages and habits (caddisfly larvae, dragonfly larvae, adult backswimmers, waterstriders, and whirligig beetles) had much lower mean Ca concentrations, ranging from about 0.6 mg g(-1) (beetles) to 1.8 mg g(-1) (caddisflies). Invertebrate-Ca concentrations decreased with increasing body mass for several taxa, with smaller and larger individuals providing similar absolute amounts of Ca. Ca concentrations in most aquatic insects (but not molluscs) were reduced under acidic, low Ca, high Al, low dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and/or low total phosphorus (TP) conditions. In stepwise multiple regressions, pH was consistently the main factor explaining variability in invertebrate-Ca, after controlling for the negative relationship between invertebrate-Ca and body mass for some taxa. Molluscs were absent from lakes below pH 5.3. In general, concentrations of P and metals in invertebrate taxa were not significantly correlated with lake pH. Levels of Al, Cd, or Pb were not sufficiently, high to be considered toxic to potential consumers of these organisms. For waterfowl and other birds breeding in acid-stressed habitats and relying on aquatic invertebrates as a source of food, a reduced availability of dietary Ca is more likely than an increased exposure to toxic metals to negatively affect reproductive success, especially when other adverse effects of acidification (lower diversity of prey) are considered.

AB Clopyralid, picloram, 2,4-D and a mixture of 2,4-D plus picloram, (Tordon(R) 202C) were added to the water of 1 m square enclosures in a prairie wetland in Saskatchewan, Canada to produce concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mg active ingredient litre(-1). Effects on the submersed macrophytes, Potamogeton pectinatus and Myriophyllum sibiricum, were monitored by taking repeated measurements of plant weight, flower and tuber production and inspecting for injuries at 30 and 60 days after application. Clopyralid did not inhibit weight gain (growth) in either species, but stimulated growth and flowering by M. sibiricum at 0.01 mg litre(-1) and tuber production by P. pectinatus at both rates. The low rate of 2,4-D stimulated flowering by M. sibiricum and tuber production by P. pectinatus, whereas the high rate inhibited growth of M. sibiricum and injured both species. Picloram did not affect growth of either species, but injured M. sibiricum at both concentrations and inhibited flowering at 0.1 mg litre(-1). Tordon(R) 202C at 0.1 mg litre(-1) caused reduced growth and flowering in M. sibiricum and injured both species; 0.01 mg litre(-1) also injured M. sibiricum. Mortality resulted only from Tordon(R) 202C and 2,4-D. Field data are lacking to assess the extent to which submerged macrophytes in prairie ponds are exposed to harmful concentrations of herbicide from aerial spraying, drift from ground application, runoff or wind erosion of soil.

AB Drainage ditches and ground-water gradients in abandoned agricultural sapric peatlands (mucklands) produce distinctive vegetation patterns. Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.

TI Tissue culture and plant regeneration of big cordgrass, Spartina

ID CALLUS-CULTURES; GRAMINEAE
AB Big cordgrass, Spartina cynosuroides (Poaceae), grows in extensive stands in brackish marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States and along the margins of tidal streams where freshwater wetland plants dominate the back marsh. Since big cordgrass is a species of ecological importance in wetland replenishment, a tissue culture and regeneration protocol was developed for it. This protocol provides a mechanism for producing improved varieties. Spartina cynosuroides callus was initiated from the mesocotyl of sterile seedlings grown on both a medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts + 3% sucrose + 0.5 mg l(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine + 1 mg l(-1) 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid + 0.5 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 5% coconut water and a medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts + 3% sucrose + 1 mg l(-1) Indole-3-acetic acid and 1 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, but not from seedlings germinated on the previous medium plus 5% coconut water. Shoots formed from callus after it was transferred to a shoot regeneration medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts plus 1.0 mg l(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine. Roots formed from the base of these shoots after the larger shoots were transferred to root regeneration medium containing reduced-strength Murashige and Skoog medium. The mode of plant regeneration was via organogenesis, and the regenerated plants have set viable seeds in the greenhouse. This callus culture and regeneration procedure will be useful for producing S. cynosuroides somaclonal variants with superior characteristics for wetland restoration and creation in stressful habitats.

AB This study compares densities of common larval dipterans collected from areas dominated by Pontederia cordata in 10 natural and 10 created freshwater herbaceous wetlands in central Florida. At each wetland, 7 core samples were collected from each of 5 stations during summer 1993. In addition, stem densities, vegetation areal coverage, pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, water depth, conductivity, sediment quality, and leaf litter were measured at 3 locations near each of the 5 stations in each wetland. Of the 57 dipteran taxa collected, 20 occurred with sufficient abundance to justify statistical comparison. Despite a large sampling effort, there were no significant differences in densities of 20 commonly occurring taxa found in created and natural wetlands after considering the effect of multiple univariate tests. Comparison of environmental variables showed significant differences in stem densities for vegetation other than P. cordata, pH, conductivity, and sediment quality. Canonical correspondence analysis, used to relate environmental and biological variables, suggests that pH, conductivity, and sediment quality are only weakly related to dipteran community structure. Despite differences in environmental conditions, there is no convincing evidence of differences in natural and created wetland dipteran communities.

AB We assessed the potential for reestablishment of endangered piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) at selected Great Lakes beaches by comparing invertebrate biomass and abundance with that at alkali wetland beaches occupied by breeding plovers in the Great Plains. We measured invertebrate occurrence using sticky traps secured to beach foraging substrates. Diptera (especially Chironomidae and Ephydridae) comprised from 45 to 99% of invertebrate abundance and 24 to 53% of the biomass at six separate sites in the Great Lakes. Coleoptera (< 1-17% abundance; 28-54% biomass) and Hymenoptera (< 1-10% abundance; < 1-9% biomass) also were frequently detected on beaches at the Great Lakes sites. At alkali wetland beaches in North Dakota, Diptera (Ephydridae and Chironomidae) comprised 95% of the invertebrate fauna numerically and made up more than 80% of the biomass. The mean invertebrate biomass at two Great Lakes beaches (Platte Bay, MI = 0.16 g/m(2)/hr; Long Island, WI = 0.11 g/m(2)/hr) was similar (P > 0.05) to that at North Dakota alkali beaches (0.09 g/m(2)/1 hr) occupied by breeding piping plovers. However, at four other Great Lakes beaches, we measured 3 to 6 times less (0.01-0.02 g/m(2)/hr; P < 0.01) invertebrate biomass than at the alkali wetland beaches. Mean invertebrate abundance showed similar patterns among the sites. Food availability may limit the reestablishment of piping plovers at some Great Lakes beaches. We recommend that invertebrate abundance and biomass be measured at currently occupied piping plover nesting areas in the Great Lakes and be assessed at any sites proposed for reintroduction of piping plovers.

AB Five replacement wetlands in Ohio, USA, were investigated to determine their ecological and legal success. Hydrology, soils, vegetation, wildlife, and water quality of each wetland determined their functional success. The progress of the wetlands was also compared to their legal requirements. Four of the five wetlands (80%) were in compliance with legal requirements and the same four wetlands demonstrated medium to high ecosystem success. For the four wetlands, a replacement ratio of 1.4:1 was achieved for area, and depressional wetlands were generally replaced with depressional wetlands.

AB The crayfish Procambarus alleni is abundant in densely vegetated habitats within the freshwater wetland mosaics of central and southern Florida. We performed laboratory experiments to determine whether habitat preference and/or predation could account for habitat use by this species. First, groups of crayfish were placed into tanks divided evenly into vegetated and non-vegetated sides, and habitat use was measured during the day and night. Crayfish preferred vegetated habitats during both the day and night, although use of non-vegetated habitats increased significantly at night. Next, different size classes of crayfish were exposed to predatory largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in experimental tanks of varying habitat complexity (i.e., plant biomass). Bass reduced survival of small-sized crayfish but had no effect on larger crayfish. Larger crayfish also seemed to prey upon smaller crayfish. Susceptibility of crayfish to predation decreased with increasing habitat complexity. Experimental results are consistent with field observations and indicate that predators and habitat complexity play important roles in determining the distribution and daily activity of P. alleni within wetland habitat mosaics.

AB We examined macroinvertebrate trophic relationships in stands of two emergent plants, pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) and alkali bulrush (Scirpus robustus), and in epiphytic and benthic habitats within pickleweed stands. Numbers of detritivores, predators, and herbivores were examined throughout the flooding season (October 1990-March 1991). Trophic structure of macroinvertebrate communities differed between epiphytic and benthic habitats; both herbivores and detritivores were abundant in epiphytic habitats, but detritivores alone were numerically dominant in benthic habitats. Macroinvertebrate communities also differed between pickleweed and alkali bulrush stands: (1) all trophic groups were abundant in pickleweed. but detritivores were numerically dominant in alkali bulrush: (2) pickleweed supported higher macroinvertebrate numbers than alkali bulrush. Species composition was similar in both vegetation types, and diversity decreased during the season. Macroinvertebrate trophic structure in the epiphytic habitats changed during the season; detritivores quickly colonized both vegetation types after flooding, and predator and herbivore numbers increased later. Herbivores were an important component of macroinvertebrate communities in these wetlands, indicating that algal herbivory may be more important than previously thought.

ID RESPONSES; PINE
AB Spectral measurements were recorded for leaves from two monospecific stands of Acer rubrum in an attempt to characterize leaf reflectance at different stages of flooding. The stands occupied two different soil types possessing different soil moisture regimes. Leaves were excised from different parts of the trees, and their reflectance properties were measured with a hand-held spectroradiometer recording from 400 to 900 nanometers in 3-nm increments. Soil redox potentials were recorded at the sites in an attempt to characterize stress as a function of the soil reducing conditions. Spectral curves, reflectance peaks, soil moisture observations, and redox potentials were plotted and analyzed to document the conditions of the trees during a two-and-a-half month period in the early local growing season. Compared to non-hooded trees, spectral measurements for flooded trees showed elevated reflectance in both the green spectral region at 550 nm as well as the near infrared region at 770 nm. In addition, the reflectance measurements were strongly related (r greater than or equal to 0.80) to redox potentials recorded during the same period. The results indicated that spectrally detectable changes in visible and near infrared leaf reflectance may be more influenced by prolonged flooding than saturation This suggests that where remote sensing is used for wetland mapping, there may be optimal times to spectrally separate stands of forested wetlands during the growing season.

AB Transect measurements, continuous monitoring, and synoptic surveys were used to examine pat terns in light availability, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations within and outside emergent vegetation zones in Goose Lake Marsh, a natural prairie pothole wetland in central Iowa. Water column light availability was less than 2% of ambient light in emergent vegetated areas due to canopy cover, small floating plants (lemnids), and plant litter. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly lower and varied less diurnally in vegetated areas. Three habitat zones could be identified based on patterns in vegetation and dissolved oxygen: (1) a zone of dense emergent macrophytes providing significant submerged structure but with nearly or completely anoxic water, (2) a transition zone of sparse emergent macrophytes providing less structure but with more aerobic water, and (3) an open water zone with consistently aerobic water but with little submerged structure. Vegetation patterns are likely to control major aspects of wetland biogeochemistry and trophic dynamics, and wetlands should be viewed as complex mosaics of habitats with distinct structural and functional characteristics.

AB Bottomland hardwood forests are distributed along rivers and streams throughout the central and eastern United States, with the greatest concentration in the Southeast. Past and projected losses of bottomland hardwoods and degradation of remaining stands suggest that habitat management and/or restoration strategies that target multiple species and multiple uses will be necessary to maintain, enhance, and restore flora and fauna within bottomland hardwood wetlands. A greentree reservoir is a current management strategy that entails manipulating water regimes to provide habitat for wintering waterfowl. We conducted a literature review and synthesis to determine the potential impacts of greentree reservoir management on plant succession within bottomland hardwood wetlands. Greentree reservoirs carl impact vegetation establishment through several processes. Despite shortcomings of greentree reservoirs, designs similar to them could be very beneficial in restoring bottomland hardwood plant and animal communities from degraded forests provided water-level control and maintenance are substantially improved. Emulation of natural hydrologic regimes, including natural variability, could produce diverse bottomland hardwood plant communities and provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species.

ID CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS
AB Vegetation composition, soil morphology, and hydrology were characterized along wetland-to-upland gradients at six forested sites in north-central Florida to compare results of Federal wetland delineation methods with 3-5 yr of hydrologic data. Wetland and non-wetland identifications were supported by hydrology data in eight of nine plant communities. Lack of hydric soil indicators and hydrophytic vegetation in two upland communities (scrub and mixed mesic hardwoods) agreed with a deep water table. Six wetland communities (cypress dome, cypress strand, bayhead, cypress/bayhead, red maple/oak swamp. and cedar swamp) with field indicators of wetland hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation and hydric soils were inundated or had water tables at or near the ground surface at least 5% of the growing season in most years. Flatwoods communities, however, occurred at intermediate positions on the moisture gradient and could not be consistently identified as wetland or upland communities. Identification of flatwoods as wetlands depended on wetland delineation method and was not usually supported by hydrologic measurements. In the flatwoods community, soil properties and vegetation composition were correlated with the mean and standard deviation of water-table depths, as well as the depth continuously exceeded by the water table at least 5% of the growing season in most years. Various hydrologic parameters need to be considered in addition to the 5% exceedence level currently used in Federal wetland delineation guidance when characterizing wetland conditions in low-gradient areas such as flatwoods.

ID SLUG TEST
AB In the Barney Circle wetland in southeast Washington DC, a proposed site for wetland enhancement and creation, ground water supplied over 80% of the flow into the wetland from 25 March to 17 August 1994. In most months, the primary outflow from the wetland occurred as ground-water flow, but in April, almost all the outflow was surface water. Rain, runoff, and changes in storage account for less than a third of the observed surface-water discharge from the wetland to the Anacostia River in April and May. This indicates that ground-water inflow was the major source of water. Although it is only a first order basin, the wetland had a small but definite flood-control function. Peak surface-water discharges out of the wetland during a storm event were reduced by 38 to 80% compared to surface-water inflow into the wetland. The time during which storm outflow occurred was much longer than the time of storm inflow. Proposed construction of a highway will result in a 13% reduction in the recharge area of the Barney Circle watershed. A calibrated ground-water how model of the watershed suggests that this will result in a 27% decrease in baseflow discharge from the wetland. The hydroperiod of the wetland will only be slightly affected, however. By modifying the calibrated watershed model, it was possible to design a modified topography of the wetland that will favor desired plant communities. However. modifying the hydroperiod will require a much greater depth of excavation than would have been predicted based on the average hydroperiod either before or after highway construction. Excavation of the wetland will cause ground water in the surrounding uplands to drain more quickly than previously. This change in the hydrology had to be taken into account in the design. This study illustrates how failure to consider the effects of site alteration on local hydrology could result in project failure.

DE bulk density; matrix chroma; organic matter; pH; reference wetland; soil
   texture; total nitrogen; wetland creation project
AB Soil organic matter content, matrix chroma, bulk density, total nitrogen, and pH were compared in naturally occurring reference wetlands and wetland creation projects in Pennsylvania. Soil samples were collected at two depths, 5 cm and 20 cm. from randomly selected points in 20 reference wetlands and 44 wetland creation projects. Reference sites contained more soil organic matter at 5 cm than wetland creation projects. Reference wetlands were higher in organic matter at 5 cm than at 20 cm, while wetland creation projects were uniform between the two depths. No relationship was found between time elapsed since construction and soil organic matter content in wetland creation projects. Neither landscape position nor wetland class significantly accounted for the variance in soil organic matter between reference wetlands and wetland creation projects. Organic matter was negatively related to pH, bulk density, and chroma and was positively related to total nitrogen. Hence, reference wetlands had lower pH, bulk density, and matrix chroma and were higher in total nitrogen than wetland creation projects. Wetland creation projects contained more sand and less clay than reference wetlands at 20 cm, and reference wetlands were siltier at 5 cm.

AB This effort is the first approximation for an inventory of Greek wetlands that will be used to create a national archives of wetland information. The objectives of this study were to a) collect data on characteristics, functions, threats, and positive actions related to the use of wetlands, b) design and develop a data base with the above information, and c) depict part of these data on a digitized thematic map. The project consisted of a) design of a questionnaire that would be easy to understand and fill out, comprehensive, and compatible with data formats of other international data bases (Ramsar Bureau, CORINE Biotopes), b) distribution of the questionnaire, c data quality control, di design and development of the data base, and e) depiction of the location of the types of Greek wetlands proportional to their size on a scale of 1:1,000,000. The results included the publication of the compiled information sheets for 378 Greek wetlands. These data sheets contain information on the location, the area, the most important biotic and abiotic characteristics, the values, the uses, the pressures threatening the wetlands, the legal status, and the positive actions. Additional results included the number and the location of drained wetlands, the preliminary results on the wetland flora of Greece, and a digitized map of Greek wetlands.

AB We investigated factors influencing dabbling duck (Anas spp.) brood densities on 9 created wetlands, arranged in 4 clusters on the National Elk Refuge in western Wyoming. Because dabblers are limited by the depth they can reach while up-ending, and created wetlands were between 1.5-2.5 m deep, we examined the significance of invertebrate density in the top 25 cm of the water column and in the entire water column where brood use occurs. Total invertebrate, nekton, and zooplankton density in the entire water column measured in 1992 accounted for between 59%, 61%, and 73%, respectively, (P < 0.05) of the variation in brood density among wetlands that year. No variable measured in the top 25 cm of the water column accounted for variation in brood densities on wetlands. We suggest that vertical migrations in the water column make most invertebrates accessible to dabbler hens and broods.

AB We examined historical patterns of land use of depression wetlands (Carolina bay and bay-like wetlands) to determine if a relationship between vegetative successional changes over a 41-year period and previous human disturbances (primarily agricultural) could be established. Land cover was interpreted from 1951 (black and white) and 1992 (false color infrared) aerial photography of the Savannah River Site (a 780 km(2) federal nuclear facility in which wetlands have been relatively undisturbed since 1951). Patterns of change from one land cover to another were detected by constructing a series of frequency tables. About one fourth of the 299 wetlands identified were either pasture or cultivated in 1951, and the majority had been ditched for drainage. Agriculturally disturbed wetlands primarily became mixed hardwood/pine or were converted to pine plantations by 1992 however no successional differences between wetlands that were cultivated versus pasture were detectable. The type of land use of many of the depression wetlands prior to 1951 probably was determined by physical characteristics of the wetlands (e.g., topographic position, size, and hydrologic features). Thus, in many cases, separation of recovery trajectories: from other successional pathways, initial hydrogeomorphic differences, and/or continued human influences is not possible in this study. However, from this change-detection study, we recognize that many of the currently protected depression wetlands at SRS were disturbed by agricultural practices or were impacted by hydrologic alterations prior to 1951, implying considerable resilience in the recovery toward a functioning wetland condition if hydrologic regimes are restored. A significant finding of this study is the relative stability of herb-dominated bays, which indicates that this vegetation type is not necessarily a successional continuum toward an eventual hardwood forest, at least in the temporal scale of the study. Thus, we suggest that management prescriptions for the restoration/conservation of herb-dominated wetlands should incorporate concepts of temporal stability within a framework of cyclical hydrologic and vegetation changes.

ID PRAIRIE WETLANDS
AB A goal of wetland restoration is to provide habitat for breeding populations of waterfowl and other bird species. To meet this goal, it is important to determine how birds respond to restored wetlands and which factors influence their use of restored wetlands. We examined the relationship between bird species richness and years since restoration at restored prairie wetlands in Iowa. We detected 42 bird species in restored wetlands, 15 of which were breeding species. The mean number of breeding bird species was significantly greater in older restored wetlands (4.3 species in 1-year-old wetlands, 7.2 species in 4-year-old wetlands, P = 0.005). The mean number of all bird species, waterfowl species, and breeding waterfowl species did not change with wetland age. Total and breeding bird species richness increased with percent cover of emergent vegetation. Waterfowl species richness and breeding waterfowl species richness were influenced more by wetland area than vegetation characteristics, whereas total species richness and breeding bird species richness were influenced more by vegetation characteristics. If the goal of restoration is simply to provide a breeding site for waterfowl, our data suggest that this can be done in a few years. However, we favor longterm restorations. Such restorations are more likely to have a more diverse bird community that more closely resembles those found in natural wetlands.

   water-level fluctuations; water-level recorder; wetlands; wetland
   condition; wetland degradation; wetland monitoring
AB We evaluated water-level fluctuation (maximum water depth - minimum water depth/catchment size) in 12 temporary, 12 seasonal, and 12 semipermanent wetlands equally distributed among landscapes dominated by tilled agricultural lands and landscapes dominated by grassland. Water levels fluctuated an average of 14.14 cm in wetlands within tilled agricultural landscapes, while water levels in wetlands within grassland landscapes fluctuated an average of only 4.27 cm Tillage reduces the natural capacity of catchments to mitigate surface flow into wetland basins during precipitation events, resulting in greater water-level fluctuations in wetlands with tilled catchments. In addition, water levels in temporary and seasonal wetlands fluctuated an average of 13.74 cm and 11.82 cm, respectively, while water levels in semipermanent wetlands fluctuated only 2.77 cm Semipermanent wetlands receive a larger proportion of their water as input from ground water than do either temporary or seasonal wetlands. This input of water from the ground has a stabilizing effect on water-levels of semipermanent wetlands. Increases in water-level fluctuation due to tillage or due to alteration of ground-water hydrology may ultimately affect the composition of a wetland's flora and fauna. In this paper, we also describe an inexpensive device for determining absolute maximum and minimum water levels in wetlands.

AB Data related to forest cover in the Cache River Basin, Arkansas, USA were collected and analyzed to quantify changes in forest cover since 1935. Forest cover loss during the period 1935 to 1987 was characterized using data derived from aerial photography, historical map products, and Landsat satellite multispectral imagery. Forest cover in the basin declined from 65% to 15% over the 52-year period (a loss of 108,000 ha of forest cover). There was little change in forest cover between 1975 and 1987. Remaining forest stands in the basin are fragmented and small in size. Comparing forest-stand data with Soil Conservation Service data revealed that 90% of the forest loss in the southern half of the basin occurred in hydric soil areas, thus indicating a significant loss of forested wetlands.

AB This study characterizes the species composition, structure, and distribution of woody plants on the floodplain of the Cache River in northeastern Arkansas. Trees, saplings, and shrubs were sampled in 249 plots along with 28 environmental variables. Classification of the plots resulted in four forest dominance types being identified. The basal area, density, species richness, and diversity of these four types were within the range of values established for similar floodplain forests throughout the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed the distribution of species to be significantly correlated with flood depth and flood duration as well as geomorphic position and soil texture.

TI Hydrology of the black swamp wetlands on the Cache River, Arkansas
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE wetland hydrology; water budget; flood storage; stream flows; flood peak
   attenuation; flood discharge attenuation; hydroperiod
AB The hydrologic characteristics of the Cache River wetlands between Patterson and Cotton Plant, Arkansas, were investigated. The Cache River is an underfit stream with wetlands predominantly located in abandoned channels and backswamps. Much of the Cache River upstream of the study area has undergone extensive channelization to allow agricultural development in the basin. Hydrologic measurements included streamflow gages at the upstream and downstream limits of the study area, water-level recorders inside the study area, a nest of deep and shallow ground-water wells that monitored variations in the underlying aquifer, a meteorological recording station that collected precipitation, air temperature, and solar radiation data inside the study area, and regional precipitation data. Analysis of the wetland's water budget showed that the system is dominated by river discharges and that the magnitudes of other water-budget components are less than the error associated with well-maintained streamflow gages (5-10%). The system is characterized by floods occurring from late fall to late winter and again in mid-to-late spring. Peak flood discharges are approximately 185 m(3)/s for a 2-year event and 270 m(3)/s for a 5-year event. Peak discharges between the upstream and downstream gages are reduced by 10-20% with greater attenuation occurring when the system is initially drier. Peak discharge at the downstream gage lags the peak at the upstream gage by 4-8 days depending on antecedent conditions. The majority of overbank flooding is produced by backwater from several constrictions in the downstream reach of the study area, rather than from the forward movement of the flood wave. Flood-peak attenuation between the upstream and downstream gages is due mainly to floodplain storage, with flow resistance contributing minimally. Finally, the relationship between the hydroperiods at different water-surface elevation gages was examined to determine if a long-term record could be used to estimate long-term hydroperiods at interior gage locations (or perhaps at interior computer model locations) with shorter-term information.

TI Patterns of larval fish abundance in a bottomland hardwood wetland
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE forested wetlands; larval fish; reproduction; hydrology; floodplain
ID RIVER; ECOSYSTEMS
AB Larval fishes were collected with light traps and ichthyoplankton nets for two consecutive years during spring and early summer in the channel and floodplain (tupelo and oak forest) of the Cache River, Arkansas. A total of 8,113 individuals were collected between the two gears. Twenty-eight species were confirmed, but total number of taxa, including genus and family level groupings, was 35. Pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus) was the most abundant species, with 21% of the total catch consisting of this fish. Percidae (darters) was the dominant family, comprising at least seven species and accounting for 57% of the total numbers of fish collected. The families Cyprinidae and Centrarchidae were also common. Specimens that could not be identified to species made up nearly 56% of the catch. Species richness was similar among the three habitats probably due to hydraulic mixing, but individuals in the families Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Percidae were more abundant in tupelo and oak habitats than in channel for net and light trap catches. Mean catch of total individuals in nets and light traps was greater in floodplain habitats than in the channel, particularly during spring 1989. Large catches in spring 1989 corresponded to higher water levels that expanded the aquatic/oak forest transition zone compared to lower water levels in 1988. Thus, late winter and spring floods that inundate the oak forest appear to be a major factor in regulating abundance of larval fishes in this bottomland hardwood wetland.

AB During spring of 1988 and winter of 1988-89, we sampled songbird populations and habitat characteristics along two belt transects extending across the broad, forested floodplain of the Cache River, Arkansas, USA. Objectives were to compare avian abundance and species richness among floodplain forest zones and to investigate bird species distributions in relation to the wetness gradient. Forest zones differed in structure, flooding regime, and use by birds. The tupelo/baldcypress zone, in particular, provided habitat unlike that in the higher oak-dominated zones and supported a number of bird species that were much less abundant elsewhere. Distributions of chimney swifts (Chaetura pelagica), prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea), and great crested flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) were skewed toward wetter sites, whereas summer tanagers (Piranga rubra), red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus), and others were skewed toward drier sites.

AB Denitrification rates were quantified in bottomland hardwood wetland soils of the Cache River. N-15 labeled nitrate was added to columns containing wetland soils and river water. Over 40 days, nitrate-N in floodwater (approximately 9 mg N L(-1)) decreased by between 82% and 59%, which gave estimates of N export from the water column of between 11.5 mg N m(-2) day(-1) and 7.5 mg N m(-2) day(-1). These values correlated directly with organic content of surface sediment, which included forest litter. Added glucose doubled rates of nitrate loss in these soils, which indicated that the process was carbon limited. Nitrification occurring simultaneously with denitrification was determined using isotopic dilution techniques. Contributions of nitrate to water from nitrification were estimated at between 5% and 12% of the total nitrate reduced. Rates of nitrogen transformation in these forest soils were likely limited by available soil carbon from tree litter and perhaps canopy leachate, rather than by nitrate concentration in inflowing floodwater.

AB One of the often-stated functions of wetlands is their ability to remove sediments and other particulates from water, thus improving water quality in the adjacent aquatic system. However, actual rates of suspended sediment removal have rarely been measured in freshwater wetland systems. To address this issue, suspended sediment dynamics were measured in a 85-km(2) bottomland hardwood (BLH) wetland adjacent to the highly turbid Cache River in eastern Arkansas during the 1988-1990 water years. A suspended sediment mass balance was calculated using depth-integrated, flow-weighted daily measurements at wetland inflow and outflow points. Over the three-year period, suspended sediment load decreased an average of 14% between upstream and downstream sampling points. To test the idea that the suspended sediments were retained by the adjacent wetland and to determine what portion of the BLH forest was most responsible for retaining the suspended sediments, concurrent measurements of sediment accretion were made at 30 sites in the wetland using feldspar clay marker horizons, sedimentation disks, the (137)cesium method, and dendrogeomorphic techniques. Sedimentation rates exceeding 1 cm/yr were measured in frequently flooded areas dominated by Nyssa aquatica and Taxodium distichum. Maximum sedimentation rates did not occur on the natural levee, as would be predicted by classical fluvial geomorphology, but in the ''first bottom,'' where retention time of the water reached a maximum. Multiple regression was used to relate sedimentation rates with several physical and biological factors. A combination of distance from the river, flood duration, and tree basal area accounted for nearly 90% of the variation in sedimentation rates.

AB Water levels were measured monthly at 9 staff gages and 35 wells along two transects within the Black Swamp bottomland hardwood wetland and perpendicular to the Cache River in eastern Arkansas from December 1989 to September 1992 in order to (1) describe the ground-water-flow conditions at locations within a bottomland hardwood wetland and (2) determine the relation between the frequency of different ground-water-flow conditions and physical characteristics within the wetland. Three ground-water-flow conditions predominated at various times in the Black Swamp: (1) discharge of water from the alluvial aquifer to the wetland, (2) recharge of water from the wetland into the alluvial aquifer, and (3) flow of water from the wetland into the alluvial aquifer and then to the nearby Cache River (local flow). Analyses of hydraulic head differences between surface and ground water indicate that discharge occurred 31% of the measurement times at both transects, Recharge occurred 39% of the measurement times and tended to occur more often at locations that are far from the Cache River and that overlie low ground-water levels in the lower part of the alluvial aquifer. Local ground-water flow occurred 28% of the measurement times and tended to occur more often at locations close to the Cache River. Ground-water pumpage results in water-level declines in the lower part of the alluvial aquifer near the Black Swamp wetland. When compared with an area not affected by pumping, these lower ground-water levels increased the frequency of recharge of Black Swamp water into the alluvial aquifer by nearly a factor of 7, decreased the frequency of local ground-water flow to the Cache River to less than half, and decreased the frequency of discharge by about 22%.

AB A Wetlands Dynamic Water Budget Model was developed and applied to support a large field investigation of processes in the Black Swamp wetlands of the Cache River between Patterson and Cotton Plant, Arkansas. The model is called the Wetlands Dynamic Water Budget Model because it provides magnitudes for the water budget components, as well as water depths, discharges, and flow velocities throughout the modeled system. The development of the computer program is based on concepts and approaches of a number of programs in common use. It includes three dynamically-linked modules that include all the major components of a typical water budget, including precipitation, canopy interception, overland flow, channel flow, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and horizontal ground-water flow. The surface-water module of the model was applied to the Cache River in Arkansas, and augmented a comprehensive hydrologic field study by filling data gaps that occurred due to gage problems and by providing long-term simulation data for broad areas of the wetland, particularly those far away from any measurement station. The results demonstrated that these wetlands are inundated primarily from the backwater produced at downstream constrictions, rather than from the forward-moving flood wave.

ID RETENTION
AB Mass flux measurements collected between April 1987 and September 1990 at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the Cache River Wetland (CRW), a bottomland hardwood forest in eastern AR kansas, were used to estimate long-term, average removal efficiencies (RE, %) for inorganic suspended solids (ISS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The observed removal efficiencies were used with a steady-state, first-order removal model to compute removal rate constants. Detention time of the CRW was determined with a time-varying, two-dimensional, depth-averaged, numerical Bow and transport model. The computed average detention time of 5.02 da was close to the average hydraulic retention time of 5.15 da, justifying the plug flow assumption of the model. The removal rate constants estimated from the CRW data for ISS, TN, and TP were 0.066 m/da, 0.048 da(-1), and 0.0058 m/da (2.1 m/yr), respectively. The denitrification rate constant estimated for the CRW was 0.24 da(-1). These rate constants are in general agreement with values obtained from the literature.

DE forested wetlands; hydrology; ground water; land use; agriculture; Cache
   River; Arkansas
AB Impacts to the hydrology of the Cache River, a major river system in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, were assessed by integrating hydrologic analyses with a review of historical land use changes. Extreme low flows have become more frequent in recent years, coincident with a dramatic increase in rice farming in the basin and its associated irrigation. Annual drawdowns in the alluvial aquifer were positively correlated with the annual area of rice crops. There is no evidence that a change in climatic conditions accounts for the increase in extreme low flow frequency. In fact, multiple regression analyses indicate the relationship between climate and flow is weakest in more recent decades when extreme low flows were more prevalent. Low flows in the summer (when rice irrigation occurs) were least associated with climate in most recent decades.
   Average monthly flows for August and September have increased, which is also an impact consistent with rice agriculture practices. Water is drained from rice fields to surface-water drainages at the end of the summer and may eventually reach the Cache River, thus increasing late summer flows. The timing and nature of changes in agricultural practices within the Cache River basin suggest agricultural impacts have contributed to the observed changes in hydrology.

AB A hydrologic analysis of historic stream gage data collected on the Cache River at Patterson, Arkansas is presented as a basis for impact analysis of riverine wetlands. Subtle, long-term changes in hydroperiod that could collectively have major impacts on wetland functions are quantified. Harmonic analysis, time-scale analysis, and conventional methods of hydrologic analysis of gage data at decade intervals are employed. These various techniques indicate a steady decline in the magnitude and predictability of the base flow during low flow periods, beginning with the 1920s and becoming increasingly more pronounced into the 1980s. Complementary information suggests that hydroperiod alterations can be associated with increased ground-water pumping and associated land use changes in the Cache River basin. Hydrologic indices wer developed that range from intuitively simple but generally insensitive indices based on means, medians, ranges, and discharge-duration curves to indices that are based on methods sensitive to subtle changes in hydrologic patterns. One set of sensitive indices generated by harmonic analysis is relatively simple to obtain and useful to explore changes in the pattern of discharges or stages in wetlands. The timescale analysis can be employed to provide a relatively high resolution quantification of changes in hydrology that can be related to long-term changes in land- or water-use patterns. The hydrologic methods presented in these analyses are simple enough for routine application (when adequate data are available) but sufficiently sophisticated to identify subtle changes in hydroperiod associated with impacts and passage of time. Changes in hydroperiod identified by these methods may have the potential to explain changes in biotic communities or wetland structure as part of comprehensive wetland studies.

AB Ground, surface, and soil waters from a 500-ha wetland surrounding Lunby and Stewart Lakes, approximately 24 km northwest of Grand Forks, ND, have a large range of delta D and delta(18)O values and appear to be mixtures of infiltrating modern meteoric water, evaporated modern meteoric water, and ancient water upwelling from the artesian regional aquifer system (''Dakota aquifer''), which subcrops some 30-50 m beneath the low-permeability glaciolacustrine silty clays underlying the wetland. The Dakota component is brackish and has delta D approximate to -135 parts per thousand, delta(18)O approximate to -18 parts per thousand. its isotopic composition indicates that it probably originated primarily as Pleistocene glacial ice. The stable isotope evidence suggests that shallow ground waters are richest in modern meteoric and evaporated meteoric water, but also that a substantial component (up to similar to 65%) of Dakota water has reached the vicinity of the water table at some well sites. Upwelling and evaporation of this Dakota water probably account for the high salinity of soils and some shallow ground waters in the wetland. Although delta D and delta(18)O values indicate that the proportion of modern meteoric water decreases with depth, a modern meteoric component has evidently penetrated to at least 13 m, the depth of the deepest borings on site. The deep penetration of modern water in spite of dominantly upward hydraulic gradients is also indicated by the presence of bomb tritium in one of the deeper monitoring wells. The wetland's budget of surface and soil waters seems currently to be dominated by meteoric components; ground water upwelling from the Dakota aquifer is evidently subsidiary.

ID EMISSIONS; WETLANDS
AB This study evaluated quantitative indices (soil organic matter, labile C, and sulfate concentrations) correlated with methane production rates along related vegetation and salinity gradients in the Louisiana coastal marsh region. Expressed on a soil dry mass basis, soil labile C was the variable most closely correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.69). Expressed on a surface area basis, labile C and SO42- were both significantly correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.36). Lower CH, production rates in saline marshes were attributed to higher SO42- content per unit area. This effect was confounded with the effect of plant species changes along the salinity gradient. Soils under Spartina patens produced less CH4 if collected from brackish marshes than from less saline intermediate marshes. Thus, variation in CH4 production across the broader gradient was not a result of plant species changes alone. Laboratory production data such as this can be useful in designing sampling schemes for future studies of field CH4 emissions.

TI Beaver ponds create wetland habitat for birds in mountains of

DT Article
DE beaver; waterfowl; ducks; riparian; Wyoming
ID WATERFOWL BROODS
AB We studied the use of beaver ponds and associated wetlands by ducks and waterbirds on the Laramie Range, Albany County, Wyoming, during 1994. Our goal was to identify physical habitat features of beaver ponds associated with use by migrating, breeding, and postbreeding ducks and other birds associated with aquatic habitats. Species richness of birds observed at beaver ponds was positively correlated with water surface area, area of shallow water, length of woody shoreline, and shoreline development (the ratio of shoreline length to the circumference of a circle of the same area as the water surface of the pond). Duck use (green-winged teal, mallard, and ring-necked duck) was positively correlated with water surface area, area of shallow water, and length of woody shoreline, but negatively correlated with the ratio of the area of submergent vegetation to water surface area. Use by riparian birds (red-winged blackbird and Brewer's blackbird) was positively correlated with water surface area, area of shallow water, area of emergent cover, and length of woody shoreline.

AB We investigated patterns of differential habitat occupation by the crayfish Procambarus alleni, a numerically abundant and trophically important species in freshwater marsh systems of southern Florida. Crayfish were collected from emergent wet prairies and sloughs in marshes forming the headwaters of the St. Johns River, Florida between August 1992 and December 1993. In addition to differences in plant species composition, wet prairies had greater plant biomass and lower water depths than sloughs. Mean density and biomass of crayfish were significantly higher in the densely vegetated wet prairies (28 per m(2); 26.9 g per m(2)) than in aquatic sloughs (3 per m(2); 1.5 g per m(2)). Crayfish density increased with increasing plant biomass (i.e., habitat complexity) in wet prairies, whereas crayfish density decreased with increasing water levels (i.e., hydroperiod) within slough habitats. Recruitment occurred throughout the study, and the majority of crayfish collected were small in size (< 1.0 g). Ovigerous females were rarely collected and were found only in wet prairies. Differences in relative risk of predation, food availability, or a combination of these factors are likely generating differences in habitat occupation by the crayfish P. alleni in this wetland habitat mosaic. Efforts to restore and manage freshwater marshes in southern Florida (e.g., Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, Kissimmee River, St. Johns River) would benefit by considering spatial aspects of the ecology of indicator taxa such as crayfish.

AB We evaluated effects of moist-soil management on soils of eight playa wetlands for 2 years. Moist-soil management involves timed drawdown and irrigation of wetlands to promote germination, growth, and seed production of mudflat annuals for use by wintering waterfowl. Moist-soil management reduced soil resistance for germination (P = 0.02), raised pH closer to neutrality (P = 0.002), but had no effect on soil moisture in the top 4 cm of soil (P = 0.16; influence on soil moisture in the root zone is unknown) or on salinity measured as conductivity (P = 0.51). Moist-soil management did not affect nitrogen and phosphorus levels in playa soils over 2 seasons (P = 0.61). As a percentage of available nutrients, more soil nitrogen was lost during the wetter year compared to the dryer year (P = 0.02) - a trend that was reversed for soil phosphorus (P = 0.004). More nitrogen was lost in the wetter year (P = 0.02); whereas, more phosphorus was lost in the dryer year (P = 0.004). This indicates potential changes in limiting nutrients depending upon local precipitation events. Apparently, nutrient cycling is rapid in playas, producing large amounts of biomass despite having lower soil nutrient pools compared to other inland freshwater wetlands. Moist-soil management is a sustainable and compatible practice for playa wetlands because it enhances naturally occurring events.

AB Repairs to legal drains in the United States may be regulated to protect adjacent wetlands under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA). However, few studies have examined effects of legal drain clean-outs on adjacent wetlands and associated migratory waterbird populations. I compare water regimes, cover-to-open water ratios, and waterbird use on Bruns, Big, Meszaros, and Kraft sloughs (BBMK) in Sargent County, North Dakota before and after the clean-out of Crete-Cogswell Drain No. 11, and relate wetland habitat loss to observed disease-related mortality among staging waterfowl in fall 1990 and spring 1991. Water regimes of BBMK were exceptionally stable, with few records of drawdowns before 1984 when the clean-out began. After the clean-out (1987-90), BBM were dry by mid-summer in all years and open area declined by 96% by 1990, whereas Kraft Slough (a control area) had water throughout all years and percent open area did not change. Numerous species of waterbirds nested in BBMK before the clean-out, and mean ranks of waterbird density were similar. After the clean-out, waterbirds failed to breed successfully in all years at BBM, and use as major waterfowl staging areas and for waterfowl hunting also ended. At Kraft Slough, use by breeding and staging waterbirds continued in all years, as did waterfowl hunting. Reduced access to fresh water after the Drain No. 11 clean-out may have contributed to a dieoff of 487 lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) from necrotic enteritis in Kraft Slough in November 1990. Loss of three major staging areas in Sargent County as a result of the drain clean-out has further concentrated migrant waterfowl, particularly during drought periods, increasing the magnitude of risk when epizootics occur in southeastern North Dakota. Ducks and geese banded in Sargent County have been recovered from 34 and 14 states, 7 and 6 provinces of Canada, and 13 and 1 other countries, respectively, indicating waterfowl populations from a wide area are potentially vulnerable to epizootics when crowded into limited roosting habitat. Despite causing the loss of wetland habitat for thousands of midcontinent waterfowl and other waterbirds, a Federal Court in North Dakota ruled that the clean-out of Drain No. 11 met the criteria necessary to be considered maintenance under Section 404 clause (f)(1)(c) and was not recaptured under clause (f)(2). This outcome suggests current law does not protect wetland functions needed to support migratory waterbird populations or associated recreational values when sites have become naturally restored through lack of maintenance of legal drains.

AB The influence of beaver (Castor canadensis) trapping on beaver and waterfowl densities and wetland habitat is not well understood, and this information is needed by managers trying to balance beaver densities and harvest and complaints of nuisance beaver with the abundance of wetlands and waterfowl. During 1988-92 in south-central Maine, we determined the density of braver colonies and beaver harvest, wetland characteristics, and density of breeding pairs of waterfowl on a 111-km(2) site recently closed to beaver trapping and a similar site open to trapping. Density of beaver colonies increased from 0.15 to 0.32/km(2) (113%) on the untrapped site but changed little (0.19-0.20/km(2)) on the trapped site. The number of beaver dams maintained by beaver and the density of beaver colonies were correlated on the untrapped site (r = 0.99, n = 4, P = 0.009) but not on the trapped site (r = -0.18, n = 4, P = 0.820). Number of wetlands was correlated with the density of beaver colonies during 1989-92 on the untrapped site (r = 0.92, n = 4, P = 0.081) but not on the trapped site (r = -0.13, n = 4, P = 0.875). Total surface area of water on the untrapped site increased from 115 to 158 ha (36%); surface area of water remained stable on the trapped area. Species of waterfowl that increased on the untrapped site included Canada geese (Branta canadensis) (4-9/100 km(2)), hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus) (23-29/100 km(2)), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) (7-12/100 km(2)). Numbers of wetlands used by pairs of each species of waterfowl increased on the untrapped site. Overall, a greater than or equal to 1-year closure of beaver trapping is sufficient to increase the density of beaver colonies, whereas a 2-3 year closure is necessary to increase wetland habitat. More than 3-4 years may be required to begin influencing the density of waterfowl and number of wetlands used by waterfowl.

AB We applied established methods for wetland identification in lowland and montane wet forests (rain forests) on the island of Hawaii to determine whether rain forests exhibited wetland indicators specified in delineation manuals and to examine relationships among indicators of hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland hydrology. Morphological characteristics and ferrous iron tests indicated pockets of hydric organic soils within areas mapped as Folists. Hydrophytic vegetation decisions based on prevalence values agreed with hydric soil determinations more often than did decisions based on dominant plant species. None of the rain forest types we studied exhibited wetland indicators throughout, but some sites contained scattered small wetlands occupying microtopographic lows created by cracks, folds, and undulating flow patterns in the lava bedrock. Further work is needed to identify reliable wetland indicators that can be used during drier portions of the year and to distinguish hydric from nonhydric organic rain forest soils.

ID VEGETATION DYNAMICS; MARSH
AB We examined plant recruitment from two soil seed banks used in the freshwater wetland restoration of an abandoned sand mine in South Brunswick, New Jersey. One seed bank was already present at the mine prior to restoration; the other was imported from a nearby wetland to be destroyed by road development. We also investigated the effects of pH and water regime on recruitment in a greenhouse study and assessed plant recruitment at the restoration site during the first growing season. Multivariate analysis of recruitment in greenhouse communities revealed differential responses of the two seed banks to pH and water regime treatments. In the wetland soil, species richness and plant density responded favorably to inundation and increased pH treatments. In the mine soil, species richness and density were greatest with non-inundated and unadjusted pH conditions. The imported seed bank was characterized by greater species richness (n=21) than the mine seed bank (n=14). Mean recruit density was also greater in the wetland soil (263.6 individuals/m(2)) than the mine soil (60.1 individuals/m(2)). Recruits unique to the imported wetland seed bank included a significant proportion of obligate wetland species (52.4%). More species were censused in the field study (82) compared to the greenhouse study (24), with 23.2% of species present in both studies. A lower proportion of obligate wetland species (24.0%) was present in the field. The imported wetland seed bank was the major contributor to species richness and plant density, indicating that the use of imported soils as an amendment may enhance success of wetland restoration projects.

AB We inoculated 120 wetland microcosms representing 24 different environmental treatments with seeds from a carefully chosen pool of 20 wetland plant species. The treatments were chosen to represent a variety of riverine and lacustrine wetlands, including those with slow-growing, rare species. In the first season, an annual (Bidens cernua) was most abundant in all the microcosms. Both flooding and high fertility negatively effected the other species establishment. Short-term information about establishment was not predictive of longer-term trends. After 5 years, most of the microcosms became dominated by Lythrum salicaria and, when this occurred, other dicot species were extirpated. After 5 years, flooding and fertility remained the main factors affecting species composition in the microcosms. Lythrum establishment (and dominance) was minimal when fertility was low and when the microcosms were seasonally hooded. Establishment and growth of Typha angustifolia was poor, and this was attributed to coarse substrate. These results suggest possible measures to minimize the growth of unwanted plant species in created or restored wetlands. Our results also suggest that high diversity, low biomass wetlands will be difficult to create; therefore, protection of such wetlands may deserve a higher priority.

AB Sedimentation rate and nutrient concentrations were assessed in 1989 at four sites of differing stream morphometry in the Kakagon Sloughs, a Lake Superior coastal wetland in northern Wisconsin dominated by northern wild-rice (Zizania palustris). Pre-weighed sediment traps were placed at each site along deep-to-shallow water zones. Accrued sediment was collected during five time periods corresponding to differing stages of growth in wild-rice stands. There were higher sedimentation rates at the river sites (straight sections and inside and outside curves) when compared to the backwater site. Differences were also observed among depths and at the different time periods, demonstrating the influence of vegetation on the sedimentation process in this wetland complex. Higher sedimentation rates took place closest to the vegetation-open water interface (deep zones). However, in shallow zones, a significant proportion of the annual sedimentation took place during the submersed and floating leaf stages, showing the importance of these time periods for providing an annual input of sediment to large areas of riverine habitat. Of nutrients tested, both TKN and NO3-N had lower concentrations in the period following wild-rice stem elongation. These data suggest that the early growth habit of wild-rice (submersed and floating stages) promotes pulses of nutrient-rich sediment, which are necessary for the later nutrient-demanding stages of stem elongation and grain formation.

ID DUCKS
AB We sampled duckweed (Lemnaceae) communities at 33 locations, including blackwater wetlands, on the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Three 0.10 m(2) samples were collected at each location and the biomass of the plants and the macroinvertebrates therein were determined. Significant positive correlations existed between (a) wet and dry biomass of duckweed samples, (b) dry duckweed biomass and macroinvertebrate biomass, and (c) dry duckweed biomass and species richness of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Site data (i.e., pH, Secchi depth, water depth) were not significantly correlated with duckweed biomass or macroinvertebrate biomass. Duckweed communities offer important habitat for macroinvertebrates, which in turn are a source of animal protein for wetland birds (e.g., breeding wood ducks).

AB We describe a relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use hardware/software system for use in aerial videography of wetlands and other habitats. Advantages of the camcorder we used over older models include its use of three charge-coupled device sensors, Hi-8 recording format, and fast shutter speeds. We classified several wetlands in the Sandhills of Nebraska and, for our purposes, the color video images were as good as scanned 35-mm aerial photographs taken at the same altitude. The mean (+/-SE) of the percent difference in areas classified from video and scanned photographs for three observers was 1.54+/-0.16%. The commercial (Adobe Photoshop) and public domain (NIH Image) software we used are excellent and inexpensive for interactive image classification and quantification. A low cost ink-jet printer was used to reproduce video or photographic images suitable for ground-truthing or other uses.

AB Soil seed and spore banks are seen to affect the composition and structure of plant communities, especially in wetlands. This study was conducted in a flooded mountain meadow (mallin) in the Nahuel Huapi National Park, Patagonia, Argentina. Species density and composition were determined for spring (November 1989) and autumn (April 1990) using the emergence technique. Viable diaspore( i.e., seed and spores) density was greater for autumn samples (17,063 m(-2)) than for spring samples (10,047 m(-2)). A sizeable pool of fern spores was also found, which represented 17.8 and 60.2% of the autumn and spring collections, respectively. Species composition of the seed and spore banks varied seasonally, and seeds of the dominant mallin species were only present in autumn. Seed bank species were mostly perennials, except Mimulus parviflorus. The composition of the seed bank compared with that of the above-ground vegetation yielded a relatively low correlation between germinable seeds in the soil and the surface plant community. In addition, no ferns were present in the surface community. These results suggest that neither seed nor spore banks control mallin vegetation dynamics, probably because perennial and rhizomatous plants are the dominant components of the wetland community.

AB In a laboratory experiment, the pH dependence of photosynthesis was investigated for five Sphagnum species: S. fuscum, S. magellanicum, S. girgensohnii, S squarrosum and S. fallax, that are common in mires in Ochiishi, northern Japan. The maximum photosynthetic rate of S. fuscum occurred at the lowest pH among the species. The photosynthetic rate of S. girgensohnii, S. squarrosum and S. fallax varied little between pH 5.2 and pH 7.5, whereas the photosynthetic rate of S. fuscum and S, magellanicum tended to decline as pH increased. The results indicate that S. fuscum is most adapted to acidic conditions, while S. girgensohnii, S. squarrosum and S. fallax are adapted to a wide pH range of ambient waters.

DE Everglades; Florida; hydrology; hydroperiod; plant communities; wetlands
AB Distribution and percent cover of plant species in relation to hydroperiod (i.e., depth and duration of flooding) were examined along eight vegetation transects in Water Conservation Area 3A of the Everglades where water-level recorders were either present or subsequently installed. Transects were monitored between 1978 and 1984 to detect changes in plant communities resulting from the operation of water-control structures to improve distribution of water to WCA 3A. Hydroperiod increased significantly at four transects where long-term hydrologic data were available. Distribution of some obligate wetland species such as Sagittaria lancifolia increased significantly with longer flooding duration. Several taxa, including Nymphaea odorata and Utricularia spp., showed significant positive relationships with annual increases in water depth. Typha domingensis increased in frequency and cover at two transects close to the northernmost water-control structure despite showing no significant relationship with increased hydroperiod. Therefore, it seems that some other environmental factor, such as inputs of phosphorus enriched water through the structure, may be encouraging the encroachment of this species. Improved hydroperiod may be inadequate for Everglades restoration without water quality improvements since it will likely result in monotypic stands of T. domingensis.

AB The effects of glyphosate herbicide-induced changes in wetland emergent vegetation (largely cattails, Typha spp.) on densities of ducks (Anatinae) were assessed in northeastern North Dakota. In 1990 and 1991, 17 cattail-dominated wetlands were randomly assigned to 0% (reference wetlands), 50%, 70%, or 90% areal spray coverages with glyphosate herbicide. Densities of green-winged teal (Anas crecca), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), gadwalls (Anas strepera), and ruddy ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis) were similar among treatments during both post-treatment years (P greater than or equal to 0.1). One year post-treatment, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anas acuta) abundances did not differ among treatments (P greater than or equal to 0.1), whereas two years post-treatment their abundances were greater in the sprayed wetlands than in the reference wetlands (P less than or equal to 0.1). Densities of northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) and redheads (Ayrhya americana) differed among treatments in both post-treatment years, with the 50% sprayed wetlands harboring more ducks than did the other three treatments. Percent coverage and hectares of open water were positively correlated with numbers of diving ducks (Aythyini and Oxyurini) (P less than or equal to 0.1). Dabbling duck (Anatini and Cairinini) numbers correlated positively with hectares of open water and dead vegetation, whereas their numbers were negatively correlated with percent coverage of live vegetation (P less than or equal to 0.1). Results of this study suggest that numbers of ducks were positively influenced by creating a mosaic of open water, live vegetation, and dead vegetation with glyphosate herbicide.

TI Analysis and modeling of the radiation budget and net radiation of a
   Sandhills wetland
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE radiation budget; net radiation; spatial heterogeneity; Nebraska
   Sandhills
ID ALBEDO
AB The surface radiation budget consists of the streams of incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation flux. Net radiation, the algebraic sum of these four terms, is very significant because it represents the amount of energy available to drive surface climatic, hydrologic, and biological processes. Heterogeneity of the surface is an important factor controlling the spatial variability of the radiation budget. Wetland surfaces such as those in the Nebraska Sandhills are a complex mosaic of cover types and surface conditions and, thus, have potential for great variability in their surface radiation and energy microclimate. In this study, radiation budget data collected using fixed measurement stations and mobile instruments were used to assess the degree and causes of variability in the radiation regime within a typical Sandhills wetland. The site was stratified into four subsystems, high and low marsh, subirrigated meadow, and open water. Results show that there is no significant variability of radiation regime within the marsh, but the marsh, meadow, and water are all separable from each other. Surface albedo appears to be a significant factor separating the subsystems, while the longwave energy balance functions as an ''homogenizing'' influence. Further analysis indicates that accurate estimates of net radiation can be made using only measurements of solar radiation.

   function; Iowa; Minnesota; South Dakota; hydric soils; wetland hydrology
AB Between 1987 and 1991, 1892 prairie potholes were restored in northern Iowa, southern Minnesota, and southeastern South Dakota by state and federal agencies, most as part of the Conservation Reserve Program. The total area covered by these restored wetlands is approximately 2714 ha. Most restorations are small (less than 4 ha) wetlands with a seasonal hydrologic regime. Wetlands with an ephemeral/temporary water regime are under-represented compared to their pre-drainage extent. Information on basin morphometry, hydrology, and vegetation-zone development was collected on 62 wetlands restored in 1988. Earthen dams are installed on most (73%) restorations in the region, increasing the full pool volume but not the mean depth of the basin. Overall, restored wetlands have basin morphometries that are comparable to those of similarly sized natural wetlands. About 60% of the basins had their predicted hydrology or held water longer than predicted. Nevertheless, about 20% of the projects that we examined were hydrologic failures and either never flooded or had significant structural problems. Most restored wetlands had developed emergent and submersed aquatic vegetation zones, but only a few had developed wet prairie and sedge meadow vegetation zones.

AB Buried seeds of Carer comosa and C. stricta were exposed to nonflooded and flooded conditions and natural seasonal temperature changes for 30.5 and 33 mo, respectively. At 1-, 2- or 6-mo intervals, exhumed seeds were tested for germination in light and darkness over a range of daily thermoperiods. Freshly-matured seeds of both species were conditionally dormant; maximum germination was at 35/20 degrees C, in light. Dormancy decreased in nonflooded and flooded seeds of C, comosa during late autumn and winter but the decrease was greater in flooded than in nonflooded seeds. Nonflooded and flooded seeds of C, stricta gained the ability to germinate in light during the first summer of burial and in darkness during the following winter. Seeds of neither species germinated while they were buried in pots of soil under either nonflooded or flooded conditions in the nonheated greenhouse. Nonflooded and flooded seeds of both species incubated in light and flooded seeds of C. comosa incubated in darkness had an annual conditional dormancy/nondormancy cycle, being conditionally dormant in summer and autumn and nondormant in spring. However, nonflooded seeds of C comosa incubated in darkness remained dormant, germinating to only 1%. Most nonflooded and flooded seeds of C stricta incubated in darkness had an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle, being dormant in summer and nondormant in spring. Thus, flooding influenced the annual changes in dormancy states of buried seeds of C. comosa, but it had no effect on seeds of C. stricta.

AB This study examined the response of native vegetation to varying levels of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) removal and determined its impact on subsequent loosestrife germination and establishment in a southern Ontario wetland during 1993 and 1994. The study site was treated in 1991 with varying dosages of triclopyr amine herbicide, the triethylamine salt formulation of triclopyr [[(3,4,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy] acetic acid]; 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 kg active ingredient (a.i.)/ha. Different levels of adult loosestrife control were achieved. The lowest density of adult loosestrife was observed in the 8.0 and 12.0 kg a.i./ha treatment plots where root kill was most effective. Most new adult loosestrife plants in the 8.0 and 12.0 kg a.i./ha treatment plots established from seed. The highest densities of loosestrife seedlings and grass (Gramineae) species were observed in the treatment plots with the lowest number of adult loosestrife plants (12.0 kg a.i./ha). Sedge species (Carer spp.) did not differ between treatment levels during 1993 and 1994. Loosestrife seedling densities decreased from 1993 to 1994, suggesting that increased native plant species can slow the rate of loosestrife reestablishment from the seed bank. Native vegetation seems to replace adult loosestrife for a limited time following herbicide application; however, without subsequent treatment, loosestrife will slowly reinvade a wetland.

AB The distribution and chemical fractionation of heavy metals retained in mangrove sails receiving wastewater were examined by soil column leaching experiments. The columns, filled with mangrove soils collected from two swamps in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China, were irrigated three times a week for 150 days with synthetic wastewater containing 4 mg l(-1) Cu, 20 mg l(-1) Zn, 20 mg l(-1) Mn and 0.4 mg l(-1) Cd. Soil columns leached with artificial seawater (without any heavy metals) were used as the control. At the end of the leaching experiments, soil samples from each column were divided into five layers according to its depth viz. 0-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and > 10 cm, and analyzed for total and extractable heavy metal content. The fractionation of heavy metals in the surface soil samples (0-1 cm) was investigated by the sequential extraction technique.
   In both types of mangrove soils, the surface layer (0-1 cm) of the columns receiving wastewater had significantly higher concentrations of total Cu, Cd, Mn and Zn than the control. Concentrations declined significantly with soil depth. The proportion of exchangeable heavy metals in soils receiving wastewater was significantly higher than that found in the control, about 30% of the total heavy metals accumulated in the soil masses of the treated columns were extracted by ammonium acetate at pH 4. The sequential extraction results show that in native mangrove soils (the soils without any treatment), the major portion of Cu, Zn, Mn and Cd was associated with the residual and precipitated fractions with very low concentrations in more labile phases. However, in mangrove soils receiving wastewater, a significantly higher percentage of Mn, Zn and Cd was found in the water-soluble and exchangeable fractions. Copper appeared to be more strongly adsorbed in mangrove soils than the other heavy metals. In general, heavy metal accumulation in the surface mangrove soils collected in Hong Kong was higher than those in the PRC, although the metals in the latter soil type were more strongly bound. These findings suggest that whether the heavy metal retained in mangrove soils becomes a secondary source or a permanent sink would depend on the kinds of heavy metals and also the types of mangrove soils.

AB Most landscapes contain wetland ecosystems that form transitions (ecotones) between upland and open water ecosystems. In the U.S., the Clean Water Act regulates wetlands in order to maintain wetland functions (e.g., flood protection and water quality improvement). Theoretically, wetland areas that carry out these functions are delineated for regulatory jurisdiction. Ideally, the boundary would be drawn at the point where critical functions diminish rapidly as one moves from the wetter to the drier parts of the ecosystem. Because scientific data on functional capacity are difficult to obtain, structural attributes which can be examined over shorter periods of time often are used as surrogate measures. Species composition, soil type, and hydrologic indicators all have proven to be useful indicators of wetland functioning. Thus, in delineating wetlands for any purpose, it must be remembered that wetland functions are a product of all components of the wetland ecosystem (not just vascular plants), that the wetland functions year round (not just when vascular plants are actively growing), and that critical functions (such as flood protection) will occur only at irregular intervals.
   In a landscape context, wetlands and wetland ecotones are important transition zones between uplands and aquatic ecosystems. They are sites where nutrient concentrations change as water flows between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and are thus important buffers between uplands and open waters. Research questions are suggested in two categories: (1) issues related to planning for maintenance of wetland functions, and (2) issues specifically related to effective wetland management.

AB The trends toward urban intensification and the implications to adjacent wetlands in response to the changes in the quantity and quality of runoff are considered. Four urbanization scenarios are examined as they influence inputs to wetlands; these are characterized by changes in quantity, frequency of inputs and the pathways of migrating water. The findings indicate that the mitigation of changes to the hydrologic balance, as it relates to the maintenance of gradients for ground water recharge, will require significant costs in dollars and space.

AB Subsurface moisture levels were monitored at three depths within the rooting zone adjacent to, and within, a cedar (Thuga occidentalis) swamp in Kitchener, Ontario. Soil moisture readings, rainfall, and seepage outflow to a pond were measured on 85 days over a 4-month period to evaluate fluctuations in soil moisture around the swamp. The impact of shallow subsurface water flows in the root zone and the nature of land use changes in the catchment basin were investigated. The implications of moisture level fluctuations in upland stands of trees adjacent to wetlands were examined, with special reference to provincial wetlands delineation criteria and setbacks.

AB In river floodplains, vegetation zonation is strongly influenced by water-level fluctuations. Depending on elevation level and flood intensity, a natural as well as a human-influenced environmental gradient can be observed. The natural vegetation consists of softwood and hardwood forests. Grazed marsh and grassland are the characteristic communities of agriculturally used floodplains. Individual plants occurring in floodplains must develop adaptive mechanisms in order to survive transient floods. These mechanisms are discussed at the level of life history strategies and at the physiological level in relation to the position of the species in the floodplain gradient.
   Species from the higher sites favor rapid germination after seed release while species from lower sites postpone germination or survive in the vegetative stage as a response to flooding. Flood-tolerant species are able to form aerenchymatous roots and survive submergence by their ability to accelerate shoot extension which restores leaf-air contact. Phytohormones, especially ethylene, play an important role in the adaptive responses to flooding.
   The study of adaptive mechanisms of species occurring along the floodplain gradient will result in a better understanding of flooding-related processes acting at the community level.

AB Since the 1970s, the federal government in the United States has been increasingly more active in regulating construction in wetlands. During this time many states have similarly developed programs to control development in wetlands. These regulations have necessitated the establishment of standardized procedures to identify and delineate wetlands. These methods utilize one or more types of wetland indicators, including hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and other indicators of periodic wetness associated with wetlands. Several methods have been used for wetland identification: (1) vegetation-based methods, (2) soil-based methods, (3) three-parameter methods (using plants, soils, and other signs of wetland hydrology), and (4) the primary indicators method (relying on unique features to indicate wetlands). This article reviews wetland indicators and bow they have been used in these methods to identify and delineate wetlands. Wetland mapping is also discussed. Recommendations are offered on how to improve identification of wetlands for regulatory purposes.

AB Municipal planners and engineers require a framework for assessing the potential impacts of suburban development proposals on wetlands that parallel the community and drainage planning process. The more common approach is to conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA) close to the design stage of suburban developments, well after community and drainage planning have been completed. The suburban landscape is changed frequently by decisions made early in the planning process that may affect the spatial requirements of wetland functions and values beyond the physical boundary of the wetland. The ecological or functional boundaries may straddle administrative boundaries and further complicate the environmental assessment process.
   This chapter examines the status of wetland planning in Edmonton, Alberta and describes problems with the present land use planning process and offers recommendations for the integration of administrative and ecological boundaries that can be applied broadly in developing suburban landscapes within a hierarchical planning system. It is emphasized that spatial requirements of wetland functions must be addressed early in the planning process.

AB A general definition of riparian zones as three-dimensional zones of direct interaction between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems provides a starting point for consideration of the ecological structure and function of riparian forests needed for informed management. Some fundamental ecological issues include: (1) the scale of inquiry (landscape, site), (2) structure and function of the terrestrial system (corridors for plant and animal habitat and dispersal, biodiversity conservation, succession, and species composition), and (3) ecological functions for aquatic ecosystems. Rather than presenting criteria for delineating the boundaries of riparian forests, a case is presented for the importance of management goals in determining functional boundaries of riparian forested wetlands. When considering such forested wetlands with an ecosystem approach, there can not be one single boundary defined for riparian areas that is independent of human goals and independent of scale considerations.

AB An alternative view to the delineation of wetland boundaries based on the faunal component is presented. The behavior of breeding birds in the Baldwin wetland complex located in the northeast section of the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario indicates that wetland delineation should consider the faunal component along with the botanical, hydrological, and geomorphological criteria. Although a distinct boundary existed between the wetland and upland vegetation, when the ranges of resident birds were mapped the sharpness of this boundary was not as obvious. Reasons for this included (a) wetland avian species utilized the surrounding upland sites for various life functions including nesting and territorial defense, (b) species that nested in adjacent upland sites depended on the wetland for foraging, and (c) species from other landscape units in the fragmented landscape relied on this wetland as a food source. The implications of these factors on management of the wetland are discussed.

AB Presque Isle is a recurved sand spit on the south shore of Lake Erie near Erie, Pennsylvania. Sand eroded from lake side beaches and transported to the distal end of the peninsula (Gull Point) has resulted in the extension of Gull Point and concurrent formation of shallow wetlands. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) demonstrate the use of aerial photographs to document the temporal and spatial history of wetlands on Gull Point, (2) analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of the wetlands, and (3) create a spatial and temporal framework within which hypotheses regarding the population dynamics of the biota in the wetlands on Gull Point could be generated and tested. A series of aerial photographs and image analysis techniques were used to determine the ages and initial shapes of wetlands on Gull Point, subsequent changes in the spatial configuration of the wetlands as they became vegetated, and the probability that a newly formed wetland would survive to become an established wetland. Of 17 wetlands established on Gull Point between 1946 and 1993, 15 were formed after 1973, Most formed on the bay side of Gull Point as elongated lagoon wetlands that became isolated from the bay by sand deposition. As lagoon wetlands aged, they became subdivided into wetland ''systems'' in which encroachment by Phragmites reduced the area of open water and isolated individual wetlands. Wetlands formed on the lake side of Gull Point as beach wetlands behind sand berms created by wave action during storms. Beach wetlands tended to persist for less than five years prior to destruction by wave action.

AB Wetland boundaries were delineated and surveyed in the field in a corridor approximately 47.5 km long and 152.4 m wide across Oswego County and the northern portion of Onondaga County in central New York State. These field-determined wetland areas were compared to hydric soils maps and mapped wetlands in the same corridor on federal and New York State maps. The maps were found not to agree and consistently underestimated the extent of wetlands; the federal National Wetlands Inventory maps were the least accurate, with the total wetland area underestimated by 61% compared to that delineated in the field.

AB Wetlands are hydrologic buffers by virtue of their locations within landscapes and may serve a variety of buffer roles, including that of a water quality filter strip. Water quality buffer effectiveness (with respect to storm runoff from adjacent land) depends on the ability or propensity to (1) delay flow or reduce flow velocities through the buffer; (2) reduce or minimize the stream power of overland flow; (3) produce surface runoff; and (4) maintain particular biogeochemical conditions which are pollutant specific. In addition, for riparian buffers the relative proportion of water supplied from runoff from adjacent hillslopes vs. overbank flooding is a critical consideration. In general, wetlands are inferior to nonwetlands with respect to delaying flow and producing surface runoff. Wetlands are often superior for reducing stream power and may be more or less effective than nonwetlands with respect to specific biogeochemical conditions, depending on whether aerobic or anaerobic processes are required. This is demonstrated by comparing buffer effectiveness indices of hydric and nonhydric soils for 161 soil series of the Tar River basin, North Carolina. The water quality buffer values of wetlands derive primarily from their landscape setting and vegetated status, not from their hydrologic properties. Because wetlands may be poor buffers and are themselves often critical resources, wetlands themselves should be buffered in many cases.

AB Although pits and quarries have been established and operated in close proximity to wetlands throughout southern Ontario, the nature and extent of their impacts on wetland processes and functions are not well documented. A better understanding of these impacts on local hydrogeological processes and wetland functions and on the environmental gradients which define wetland boundaries is required to effectively implement Ministry of Natural Resources wetlands and aggregate resource management policies.
   The Southern Region Science and Technology Transfer Unit of the Ministry of Natural Resources is currently assessing the range and scale of these impacts to: identify situations where significant impacts may occur; improve siting criteria and define buffer zones; identify operating practices which mitigate negative impacts; maintain local hydrogeological processes; and to develop rehabilitation strategies for the long-term protection and enhancement of adjacent wetlands. This effort is part of long-term monitoring and experimental management initiatives which will be aimed at improving our understanding of wetland gradients, boundaries, and buffer zones in relation to aggregate extraction.

AB Buffer strips are frequently suggested as a means to protect environmentally sensitive areas from nonpoint source loadings. At present, decisions on buffer widths are often based on minimum separation distances regulatory agencies specify between a sensitive area and the upland area generating the loadings. However, computer models do exist, and are able to simulate the pollutant-trapping efficiency of buffer strips. These models have the potential to assist decision makers in selecting optimum buffer widths for specific settings.
   In this study, the CREAMS model was used to assess the effectiveness of buffers in protecting a wetland located downslope from an adjacent proposed urban development site. Data sets were prepared describing both existing site conditions and midconstruction conditions. Buffer strip widths were identified which the model predicted would bring sediment loading rates during the midconstruction periods down to levels matching the loading rates associated with the existing site conditions. The modeling exercise highlighted the importance of ensuring that runoff from the upstream area enters the buffer strip as uniform sheet flow to maximize buffer strip efficiency. The modeling also proved valuable in identifying points where sediment control techniques other than buffering were needed to fully protect the wetland from excess sediment loading as a consequence of urban construction activities.

AB Approximately 70% of wetlands present in southern Ontario at the time of settlement have been lost to human uses. Significant development pressures continue on the remaining wetlands. The use of vegetated buffer strips of various widths has been recommended in the literature to protect wetland resources from adjacent land uses. These vegetated areas retain some of the pollutants and thereby reduce degradation of water quality and wildlife habitat resulting from adjacent land uses. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and other regulatory agencies require guidance on the width of vegetated buffer strips to help reduce the negative impacts of developments. To help protect the remaining wetlands, recommendations are made on various widths of buffer strips based on a review of the literature.

AB We describe efforts to obtain access for research to 81 wetland basins on 69 farms in four zones of the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. Access was obtained to 54% of the farms in areas where land was intensively cropped and 87% of farms in areas of low cropping intensity. On average, 1.35 operators had to be contacted and 1.70 interviews were required to obtain a decision on access to a farm. On 77% of the farms, cooperators placed at least one restriction on access, most commonly requiring walking access only or notification before nighttime work. Cost of obtaining access averaged $265/farm in wages and travel expenses. No cooperators were willing to sign written access agreements. Operators rescinded access to four farms and drained three wetland basins during the first year; six of the seven sites lost were in the intensively cropped portion of a low-wetland-density zone. The difficulty of obtaining and retaining research access to privately owned wetland basins in intensively cropped areas may be related to landowner attitudes towards wetlands. Researchers may have to rely on remote sensing or consider payment for access to secure representative research sites in such areas. Unwillingness of cooperators to sign access agreements may jeopardize research by the newly formed National Biological Service and other resource management agencies.

AB An inventory was conducted of small (less than or equal to 2 ha) freshwater wetlands composed of some combination of open water and emergent marsh in the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon to (1) document changes in the wetland resource since the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) was conducted (1981/1982 aerial photograph dates) and (2) identify patterns in wetland loss and degradation over a 10-year period in a rapidly urbanizing area. Wetlands identified on NWI maps were visited during summer 1992, and data on the location, wetland type, and surrounding land use or the cause of loss were collected. Of the 233 wetlands identified by NWI in 1981/1982, approximately 40% had been destroyed by human activities or were missing due to drought. Although conversion to urban land uses was the predominant cause of wetland loss from human activities, agricultural conversion accounted for about 31%. Drier-end wetlands (e.g., seasonally flooded) were missing from the landscape most frequently. Of the 141 wetlands still existing, 25% were severely degraded by human activities. Approximately half of those wetlands not severely degraded were affected by noise, and about 40% were disturbed, primarily by grazing and littering. We suggest that because land uses change quickly in rapidly urbanizing areas, leading to increased pressures to convert wetlands, resource agencies and urban planners should conduct similar inventories in other metropolitan areas. Then, demographic projections could be used in conjunction with information on patterns in wetland loss to identify and prioritize areas for wetland protection before development takes place.

AB The area of wetlands in the U.S. is being estimated as part of the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Minimal information is available to verify the effectiveness of NWI maps to inventory wetlands or delineate jurisdictional wetlands. We evaluated the use of NWI maps (1:24,000 scale) to inventory and delineate jurisdictional wetlands in the Virginia Blue Ridge. Each wetland identified in the Woolwine and Meadows of Dan NWI maps was field-checked to determine if the areas met the criteria as a jurisdictional wetland. Of the 171 palustrine wetlands identified, 91% met the criteria. Jurisdictional wetlands were delineated in four 2.5-minute study areas. Two study areas, located in the Blue Ridge Highlands region, contain 91.8 and 109.3 hectares of jurisdictional wetlands. The NWI maps indicated 2.5 and 17.4 hectares of wetlands in these two study areas. A similar but smaller discrepancy occurred in the areas mapped in the Blue Ridge Escarpment region. We concluded, because of the small scale that photo interpreters must work with and the number of wetlands located in dense woodlands, that NWI maps may not adequately inventory wetlands in the Blue Ridge. This conclusion was based on a detailed study of 22% (6888 ha) of the area covered on the NWI maps. Predominant plant species in the forested, scrub-shrub, and emergent wetlands were red maple (Acer rubrum), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus), respectively. Wetland soils were classified as Typic Humaquepts and Humaqueptic Fluvaquents.

AB Temporal changes in the pattern and distribution of tropical wetland vegetation in four small impoundments over a 28-year period were documented for a wetland ecosystem in the Olezoa drainage basin in Yaounde, Cameroon, West Africa. These impoundments were constructed along the Olezoa stream for the purpose of aquaculture and ranged in size from 1.4 to 3.0 ha, had depths between 200 to 400 cm, and were devoid of vegetation. Evaluation of the impoundments and the surrounding catchment was accomplished using low altitude aerial photographs for the years 1964, 1974, and 1986 and field surveys for the periods 1985 through 1992. The results reveal a progressive decline in open water surface area of the impoundments ranging from 70 to 100% due to plant colonization and expansion. Measured impoundment depths along profiles show more than 50% reduction from original depths of 300-400 cm to less than 150-200 cm in 1992. We suggest that vegetation colonization and expansion in the impoundments is a function of the reduction of water depth due to siltation accompanying increasing urbanization. During the period of evaluation, urbanization in the surrounding catchment tripled. Siltation in the impoundments resulted mainly from the accumulation of soil eroded from the upland accompanying devegetation and construction activities. The shallowing of the impoundments by siltation provided a favorable water-depth regime and substrate for colonization by aquatic and emergent wetland vegetation. Continued shallowing resulted in development of vegetation zones along a water-depth gradient, and the migration of these zones toward the interior of the impoundments. The history of degradation of the catchment area and siltation of the impoundments is thus recorded by temporal changes in vegetation.

AB We modified a five-step sequential extraction scheme originally developed for phosphorus (P) in lake and marine sediments for use in a Danish freshwater wetland rich in organic matter. In contrast to the original scheme, the modification suggests isolation of P associated with aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) in humic acid complexes. As in the original scheme, discrimination also was obtained between inorganic P associated with reducible forms of Fe and inorganic P associated with Al oxides. This is important because only iron-bound P is likely to be mobilized when wetland sediments become anoxic. Extraction of iron bound P was performed by use of bicarbonate-buffered dithionite and was followed by a NaOH treatment that extracted most organic bound P together with P adsorbed onto clays and Al oxides. The NaOH extract was dark brown, but upon acidification (pH similar to 1), we produced a precipitate of presumeably humic acids (HA) and a clear supernatant. The precipitate contained up to 30% of the total sediment P and significant fractions of sediment Al and Fe. Ratios of similar to 12 between HA-Al and HA-P and of similar to 2.5 between HA-Fe and HA-P suggest that most HA-P was associated with Al in the humic acid complexes. Comparison with sediment from an acid-bog lake suggests that the HA-P fraction might also be important in other freshwater sediments. A similar AI:P and Fe:P ratio was found in the humic acid precipitate from the lake sediment, indicating that the same mechanism was responsible for binding inorganic P in the humic acid complex as in the wetland sediment. When wet sediments were sieved through a 2-mm mesh and handled under N-2, the method was highly reproducible, and no further precision could be obtained by grinding the wet sediment prior to extraction.

AB Vegetation development in constructed wetlands may be accelerated by planting aquatic and emergent species, especially when wetland seed banks are not initially present. Environmental patchiness of convoluted shorelines may enhance or retard establishment of planted or natural vegetation. Development of the seed bank may be influenced both by planting patterns and by shoreline convolutions. To determine if seed bank composition differed among locations, sediment cores were removed from coves, points, and straights, and from planted and unplanted regions of the shoreline of L-Lake, on the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina. This reservoir was built in 1985; portions of the shoreline were planted in 1987; and samples were taken in 1992. Sets of cores were taken from areas with water depths up to 1 m, the permanent waterline, and 1 m above water on the shore to determine the effects of hydrology on seed bank composition. Of the 136 seed bank taxa, only 33% were well represented and 35-46% occurred only once. Water depth was the primary influence on seed bank composition. Points, coves, and straights differed in species richness over water depths but did not differ in number of germinable seeds over depths, nor did locations differ in species richness or number of plants at the waterline. Planting vegetation in L-Lake did not significantly influence the seed bank; only 10% of taxa in the seed bank were planted in 1987. Of all taxa recorded, 56% were only in the seed bank, 22% were only in the vegetation, and 13% were in both the seed bank and the vegetation.

AB Boltonia decurrens, a perennial species endemic to the Illinois River Valley, is threatened with extinction. Field observations indicate that B. decurrens is confined to areas with sandy soils formed from alluvial deposits, but there is little understanding of the factors controlling its distribution. Plans for reintroduction of the species to suitable habitats within its historical range are hampered by a lack of understanding of the site characteristics necessary for germination and seedling growth. This study examined the effect of soil texture and soil surface features on germination and growth of B. decurrens under greenhouse conditions. We found that both parameters are greater on sand, compared to clay, and on bare soil with either a smooth or lumpy surface, compared to litter-covered surfaces. These conditions are identical to those in which B. decurrens has persisted along the Illinois River and may be important in determining its distribution pattern.

AB The interaction of ground water with prairie wetlands in the Cottonwood Lake area has been the focus of research by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1977. During this time, climatic conditions at the site ranged from near the driest to near the wettest of he century. Water levels in wetlands and in water-table wells throughout the study area responded to these changing climate conditions in a variety of ways. The topographically highest wetlands recharged ground water whenever they received water from precipitation. The wetland of principal interest, Wetland P1, which is at an intermediate altitude, received ground-water discharge much of the time, but it also had transpiration-induced seepage from it along parts of its perimeter during all bur the wettest year. The large;fluctuations of the water table in response to recharge and transpiration reflect the ease with which water moves vertically through the fractured till. Lateral movement of ground water is much slower; pore-water velocities are generally less than 3 m yr(-1). The water supply to the wetlands is largely from precipitation during fall, winter, and spring. During these periods, precipitation either falls directly on the wetland, or precipitation that falls on the upland runs over frozen soils or saturated soils into the wetland. The average ratio of stage rise to total overwinter precipitation was 2.59 for the 12-year study period. After plants leaf out, precipitation generally results in much lower rises of the wetland water level. The average ratio of stage rise to over-summer precipitation was less than 1.0.

AB Planted vegetation survival and growth, hydrology, and phosphorus dynamics were monitored for the first two years of wetland development at a 6-ha created riparian wetland, in Franklin County, Ohio, USA. Herbaceous vegetation developed clear zonation and appeared to reduce the invasion of Typha spp. Of the 17 species introduced, 8 were among the 18 most commonly encountered species approximately 2 years after the wetland was constructed. Planted saplings generally survived except where they were found in standing water; Liquidambar styraciflua and Betula nigra were less successful because the site is close to their northern range. Simulation models were developed to predict hydrology, phosphorus retention, and tree growth. The site has a rapidly pulsing hydroperiod driven by runoff from storm events. Annual simulated phosphorus loading was 17.8 gP m(-2) yr(-1) and retention was 2.9 gP m(-2) yr(-1) (16% of inflow). Fifty years of tree growth simulated for each planted tree species indicated that the site will develop into a forested wetland dominated by Quercus palustris and Fraxinus pennsylvanica with basal area comparable to riparian forests but with lower stem density unless seedlings germinate from the planted trees. Lower water levels in the wetland would favor the development of the woody vegetation over herbaceous vegetation and would also favor higher retention of phosphorus.

DE ECONOMIC VALUE; WETLANDS; PUBLIC OPINION; EXISTENCE VALUE; NONMARKET
   VALUE
AB Wetland preservation produces two types of economic value: use value and nonuse (existence) value. Previous studies have focused almost exclusively on use value, yet nonuse value is becoming increasingly important, in part because it is now considered by the courts in natural resource damage assessments. This study uses the contingent valuation survey technique to estimate the total economic value of wetland preservation in New England. Respondents were willing to pay an average of between 74 and 80 dollars per year (over a five-year period) for wetlands providing flood protection, water supply, and water pollution control and between 81 and 96 dollars per year for wetlands containing rare species of plants. Aggregate value estimates ranged between 242 and 313 million dollars per year. Survey results suggest that most of this value is nonuse value-failure to consider nonuse values in decision making can therefore understate the value of preservation by a substantial margin.

By incorporating a chronosequential design that extended the time frame to about 3.5 yr, the decomposition coefficient (k) of sample logs was estimated at 0.089 yr(-1) with a half-life of 7.8 years. Mass loss by microbial activity and leaching was estimated at 90%, whereas fragmentation accounted for 10%. Nutrient analysis of the logs indicated that P and K seemed to be released, whereas N, Ca, and Mg were immobilized. Overall, Ca and N were found in significantly higher concentrations than other nutrients (Ca>N>>K>Mg>P). Because small diameter woody debris has limited quantities of nutrients and a long residence time, its role in this mature forested wetland does not seem to be a nutrient reservoir but rather a long-term organic matter storage pool.

DE WETLANDS; RESTORATION; WATER CHEMISTRY; SALINITY
AB The southeast of South Australia has a history of drainage of wetlands to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Recently, some landholders have reversed this trend by restoring the wetlands on their land to provide habitat for wildlife. The Watervalley Wetlands are the most extensive of these restored wetlands. The water is high in nutrients, hard, alkaline, and variably saline. The salinity of these wetlands varies in both time and space. Seasonal variations in salinity within the wetlands are conducive to high productivity, and the variation between wetlands ensures diversity of habitat. However, careful monitoring is required to determine whether the observed seasonal cycles of rising and falling salinities will continue or whether salinity will increase to undesirable levels at some time in the future. Long-term monitoring is also necessary to determine whether the present high productivity will continue under the prevailing water regime or whether that productivity is an artifact of the recent restoration.

AB The relationships between flooding regimes, stand structure, regeneration, and tree stress and mortality were evaluated within two overcup oak (Quercus lyrata) - willow oak (Quercus phellos) greentree reservoirs, one impoundment with levees and one without levees. Record rainfall resulted in extensive growing-season flooding in both impoundments; however, the levee system and the topographic relief of the impoundment with levees impeded drainage of surface water and prolonged growing-season flooding. Limited regeneration of all species except overcup oak was observed in both impoundments. In the impoundment with levees, the total number of overcup oak seedlings at peak establishment and overcup oak seedling mortality were related to flooding regimes. In the impoundment without levees, establishment densities were not related to any of the measured environmental variables. Stress and mortality were significantly higher in trees in larger diameter classes, and stress generally increased with flooding. These results suggest that the decision to create GTRs within a stand of naturally flooded bottomland hardwoods should be thoroughly and cautiously reviewed.

   SAMPLING
AB Although invertebrate communities are used in the evaluation of created freshwater wetlands, spatial patterns of invertebrate community structure are frequently ignored. Invertebrate distributions are generally associated with plant community distribution in natural aquatic ecosystems. In this study, 180 core samples were collected to examine associations between chironomid (Diptera) genera and emergent vegetation communities in a single created freshwater herbaceous wetland in central Florida. Three of the five common genera were significantly more abundant (p<0.05, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) in areas with greater than 50% cover by emergent vegetation than in open water, but no differences were found between areas dominated by Pontederia cordata and areas dominated by mixed emergent vegetation. Samples from an area of open water and an area with over 80% cover by P. cordata showed significant differences in abundances of all common chironomid genera (P<0.05, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test). Results suggest that sampling designs for studies comparing benthic invertebrate communities from natural and created wetlands should consider the possible associations between vegetation and invertebrate communities.

AB Procedures to maximize seed germination of Scirpus acutus (hardstem bulrush) from two geographic locations were studied in the laboratory. Pregermination conditions included scarification and stratification at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 0, 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks while submerged in water. Following the treatments, seeds were placed in night/day temperature regimes of 10/25 degrees C or 18/22 degrees C under a 14-hour photoperiod (approximate to 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD). A stratification period of at least 2 weeks significantly enhanced germination. Germination was significantly greater at 10/25 degrees C than at 18/22 degrees C. Maximum germination percentages of 97.5 and 92.5 were achieved for seed lots exposed to a 10/25 degrees C temperature regime following a 12-week cold period. Germination percentages of seeds from the two geographic locations did not differ significantly (P < 0.05).

AB We studied the pattern of amphibian distributions within 19 wetlands of the Puget Sound Basin in King County, Washington State from 1988 through 1991. Amphibian richness was compared to wetland size, vegetation classes, presence of bullfrog and fish predators, hydrologic characteristics of water flow, fluctuation, and permanence, and land use. Low velocity flow and low fluctuation were correlated with high species richness. Seasonal persistence of water was unrelated to species richness. Wetland size, distance to other wetlands favorable for breeding, fish and bullfrog predators, and the number of vegetation classes found at a wetland were unrelated to total number of species. Increasing mean water-level fluctuation and percent watershed urbanization were correlated with low species richness.
   Small and structurally simple wetlands often have high value amphibian habitat, and traditional reliance on wetland size and broad vegetation classes without site-specific studies should be avoided when assessing habitat value for amphibians.

TI ESTIMATING RELATIVE WETLAND VALUES FOR REGIONAL-PLANNING
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE WETLANDS; WETLAND FUNCTIONS; WETLAND VALUES; IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHOD;
   REGIONAL PLANNING; WATERSHED PLANNING
AB A numeric method is described for establishing the relative values of wetlands in regional planning. The method combines qualitative understanding of how local wetlands function with assessments of their regional values. The method, called the IVA (Indicator Value Assessment), is a rapid assessment method based on the assumption that wetlands having specific environmental indicators perform a wetland function better than those that do not. The importance of an indicator in the performance of a function is represented numerically. First, a performance score for a wetland is calculated by developing a numeric model for each function based on the importance scores assigned to the indicators. Performance scores are normalized on a scale of 0-100, relative to the wetland having the highest performance score in the planning region. Values for wetlands are then quantified by multiplying the area of the wetland by its performance score and by a rank score representing the relative social importance of that function. The performance and value scores can then be used to assess possible impacts from different development scenarios, identify compensation needs within a planning region, and assess the potential of different wetlands for enhancement. The IVA method is being tested and used in three wetland management plans in small watersheds: the Hackensack Meadowlands (New Jersey) Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), the Mill Creek (Washington State) SAMP, and the Snohomish Estuary Plan (Washington State).

DE BEAVER; BREEDING BIRDS; CASTOR CANADENSIS; DIVERSITY; WETLANDS
AB We surveyed 70 wetlands during winter and spring 1992 to determine the influence of beaver activity on species richness of birds. Wetlands were divided into 3 activity types (active, inactive, potential), and 3 size categories of small (< 2.5 ha), medium (greater than or equal to 2.5 < 5.0 ha), and large (greater than or equal to 5.0 ha). We recorded 32 species of birds during winter, 20-25 within each activity/size category. There were no differences (P > 0.050) among size classes in the average number of species/wetland, but the average was greater (P < 0.050) in potential (4.7) versus active sites (3.1). We detected 106 species in spring, 92% of which were in active sites. Active sites also contained the highest (P < 0.050) average number of species/wetland (29) compared to inactive sites (24) and potential sites (22). Active sites contained more open water, dead standing trees, surface water, and flooded emergents than inactive or potential sites. Wetland area (log transformed) was most correlated (r = 0.43-0.56) with richness of birds in all activity categories. Overall, beaver occupancy of wetlands may have affected bird richness most by creating intermediate ratios of cover:water.

AB The wetlands of Elk Island National Park, located in central Alberta, are characterized by their vegetation and relationships between vegetation, surface water chemistry, and hydrotopographic parameters. Thirteen marsh, swamp, fen, and bog communities are described on the basis of TWINSPAN and the Canadian Wetland Classification System. Species distribution in Elk Island is related to surface water cation gradients of corrected conductivity, pH, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Hydrotopographic features such as water level, hummock height, elevation of the site, and the number of inlet and outlet streams are of secondary importance. Nutrient levels (nitrogen and phosphorus) in surface waters are less significant. Significant correlations were not obtained between vegetation and surface water nitrate levels or peat depth. Marshes, swamps, and moderate-rich fens at Elk Island are circumneutral in pH and rich in calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Poor fens and bogs are acidic, with lower amounts of mineral cations. The ionic gradient at Elk Island is related to fluctuating water tables and water source (ombrogenous vs. minerogenous). Hydrotopography influences the water chemistry. At Elk Island, marshes and swamps are low elevational wetlands and have the highest number of inlet and outlet streams; fens are found at intermediate elevations with fewer inlet and outlet streams; and bogs are found at the highest elevations with the fewest number of inlet and outlet streams.

AB Plant succession and various environmental conditions can decrease productivity of wetlands managed intensively for wildlife. Although prescribed fire frequently is used to alter plant composition and structure in semipermanent wetlands, the impacts of fire on species composition and production of seed in moist-soil impoundments have not been quantified. Therefore, I compared species composition, seed production, and soil macronutrient concentrations at the end of the growing season on unburned control sites (n = 3) and sites burned in spring (n = 3) and summer (n = 3) in southeast Missouri. Sites burned in spring contained a greater (P less than or equal to 0.05) percent cover of beggarticks (Bidens spp. [31.4 +/- 4.7%]) and ricecut grass (Leersia oryzoides [50.3 +/- 7.0%]) than control and summer-burned sites. The percent cover of marsh elder (Iva ciliata) was reduced (P < 0.05) on spring-burned sites (16.6 +/- 2.2%) compared to control sites (25.2 +/- 2.3%) but was lowest on sites burned in summer (0.2 +/- 0.2%). In contrast, the frequency of occurrence (100.0 +/- 0.0%) and percent cover (76.9 +/- 5.9%) of bare ground was greater (P < 0.05) on sites burned in summer than on control and spring-burned sites. Summer fires also increased (P < 0.05) the frequency of occurrence and percent cover of morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea [30.0 +/- 10% occurrence; 0.4 +/- 0.1% cover]) and sesbania (Sesbania exaltata [70.0 +/- 10.0% occurrence; 5.3 +/- 0.5% cover]). Total seed biomass also differed (P < 0.05) among treatments; sites burned in spring produced the most seed (33.7 +/- 3.9 g m(-2)), followed by control (12.6 g m(-2)) and summer-burned sites (0.0 +/- 0.0 g m(-2)). Soil pH, organic matter content, neutralizable acidity, cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of P, K, Ca, and NO3-N did not differ (P > 0.05) among control sites and sites burned in spring and summer. In general, burning in spring improved habitat and food conditions for waterfowl, whereas burning in summer reduced the prevalence of both desirable and undesirable vegetation and created habitat conditions that favored shorebirds.

Indices of aquatic invertebrate abundance, biomass, and taxon richness were all lower in wetlands containing fathead minnows. Reductions in abundance and biomass of insects and crustaceans in wetlands with fathead minnows were pronounced during both years. Our results indicate that at high densities, fathead minnows may severely depress abundance, biomass, and taxon richness of aquatic invertebrates in semipermanent prairie wetlands, thereby reducing the suitability of these habitats as seasonal foraging areas for waterfowl.

Winter aboveground living biomass was higher at Fenton than at Ithaca probably owing to the longer growing season at Fenton caused by the warm leachate, which averaged 4-8 degrees C during the winter. Uptake of nutrients was also greater at Fenton, with aboveground and belowground N uptake by plants approximately 35 g m(-2). Such uptake means that P. arundinacea over the total area of the beds may utilize about 10% of the yearly N input and lesser amounts of other nutrient elements.

DE MICROTOPOGRAPHY; MICROSITES; ATLANTIC WHITE CEDAR; SWAMP; WETLANDS;
   PEAT; SPHAGNUM
AB Atlantic white cedar wetlands have pronounced hummock-hollow microtopography, in which the hummocks may be covered by Sphagnum spp. or may have only a layer of needle and leaf litter present. I tested the hypotheses that characteristics of the hummock peat, including moisture content, bulk density, redox potential and fiber content, would vary linearly with elevation above the water table, and that these relationships would not vary between moss- and litter-covered surfaces. These hypotheses underlie the frequent use of microsite elevation as an indicator of habitat differentiation in wetlands. I found that moisture and redox potential varied with elevation, but bulk density and fiber content were independent of elevation. Furthermore, moisture and redox status on Sphagnum-covered microsites had a weaker relationship to elevation (lower slope coefficient and lower r(2)) than on litter-covered microsites. Principal components analyses showed that Sphagnum-covered microsites were differentiated primarily on the basis of the relative content of undecomposed and decomposed fibers, while litter-covered sites were differentiated primarily on the basis of moisture and elevation. These results suggest that environmental gradients on hummock-hollow systems are complex and not a simple reflection of elevation. Environmental disturbances that reduce Sphagnum cover may affect vegetation by creating more drought-prone microsites on the tops of the hummocks, and this may be important for management of cedar regeneration.

DE WETLAND MAPS; OPERATOR CRITERIA; LOCATION ACCURACY
AB A six-channel Global Positioning System was used to locate eleven points on wetland boundary lines. The latitude and longitude of these points were compared to locations obtained by a second order ground survey. Operating criteria and tree foliage coverage varied over a 19-month period of data collection (February 1992 to October 1993). Canopy coverage levels sampled within a hurricane impacted area, did not increase horizontal position error as much as percent of readings that had only 3 satellite (2D) coverage. If at least 60 readings were made at each point and more than 50% of the total readings had 4 satellite (3D) coverage, the average horizontal distance error was 3m. Beginning in June 1993, with appropriate adjustments in data collection and data manipulation, 5-m accuracy was obtained 95% of the time regardless of time of year, level of canopy coverage, or height of antenna. These accuracies seem to be sufficient for boundary surveys of delineated wetlands for routine regulatory purposes. Criteria for data collection should be specified so that the accuracy of the data can be evaluated.

TI FACTORS CONTROLLING THE FORMATION OF OXIDIZED ROOT CHANNELS - A REVIEW
SO WETLANDS

   DELINEATION; IRON PLAQUES OR DEPOSITS; ROOT OXYGEN LOSS; WETLAND
AB Although root plaques and associated oxidized root channels are used for wetland identification as field indicators of wetland hydrology, little information is available concerning their reliability as related to the environmental and biotic factors controlling their formation. Therefore, this review describes and evaluates the current state of knowledge of the factors controlling the formation of iron plaques and recommends research to address information gaps.
   Both abiotic and biotic factors control the presence and degree of iron plaque formation. The most important abiotic factor is the availability of soil iron. However, the effect of site variation in soil physico-chemical characteristics (e.g., texture, organic matter, pH, Eh, and soil fertility) on iron availability and microbial activity can influence the formation and persistence of root plaques and oxidized root channels. Although the oxidizing capacity of the plant root is the most important biotic factor controlling plaque formation, only a limited number of wetland species have been evaluated for this ability, so species-specific differences are generally unknown.
   Unlike some of the other hydrologic indicators used in wetland delineation (e.g., water marks on trees or sediment deposits) root plaques and oxidized root channels indicate soil saturation for a sufficient period to produce anaerobic soil conditions. Additionally, when found in conjunction with a living root, oxidized root channels indicate that the anaerobic conditions occurred within the life span of the plant root. Therefore, the presence of oxidized root channels and iron plaque surrounding living roots is a relatively good indicator of current wetland hydrologic conditions. However, research is needed to elucidate the relative abilities of different plant species to produce oxidized root channels, the temporal persistence of the root iron plaque and the role that soil physico-chemical condition plays in controlling plaque formation. Without a better understanding of the controls on iron plaque formation and disappearance, the absence of oxidized root channels, in itself, should not be used to indicate the absence of a wetland.

TI HYDROLOGY OF A CAROLINA BAY LOCATED ON THE UPPER COASTAL-PLAIN OF
   WESTERN SOUTH-CAROLINA
SO WETLANDS

DT Article
DE CAROLINA BAY; HYDROLOGY; WATER BALANCE; WETLANDS
AB Thousands of Carolina bays are found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain between northern Florida and New Jersey. Most of these shallow depressions are wetlands, and many hold temporary ponds that fluctuate in response to seasonal or long-term climatic conditions. Despite the abundance of bays, few studies have described their hydrologic regime. This study examines the hydrologic interactions of Thunder Bay, a 7-ha Carolina bay located on the Upper Coastal Plain of western South Carolina. Data from 38 piezometers, borehole logs, and records of pond stage and weather indicate that water ponded at Thunder Bay is a surface expression of the water table. Although fluctuation of pond stage is largely controlled by precipitation and evapotranspiration, nearly continuous seepage losses coupled with periodic ground-water inflow are also important components of Thunder Bay's hydrologic regime.

DT Article
DE WETLANDS; IRON; SEQUENTIAL METAL EXTRACTIONS; SULFATE REDUCTION; IRON
   OXIDATION; WETLAND PLANTS
AB Oxides of Fe were dominant in composite sediment samples from the upper region of simulated compost wetlands exposed to acidic mine water, accounting for nearly half of substrate iron among the three sampling stations. In the middle and lower wetland regions, however, 65% of all Fe was retained as oxidizable Fe. Inferential evidence suggests that sulfate reduction was likely to be a critical process in Fe retention over at least half of the wetland length. However, overall, oxides of Fe (including amorphous and crystalline oxides) constituted the dominant phase of Fe in the wetland. The addition of a supplemental carbon source significantly stimulated both the formation of oxidizable Fe and reducible Fe in the middle and lower wetland regions, but not near the inlet. The use of effective carbon supplements is therefore recommended in field tests at acidic sites. Over the short term, the presence or species of vegetation had no effect on the partitioning of Fe phases.

   SOIL CRITERIA; SOIL MORPHOLOGY; SEASONAL HIGH WATER TABLE; FLORIDA
AB The hydric soil definition and hydric soil criteria are often insufficient for use in held identification/delineation of hydric soils. This paper traces the experiences soil scientists and other wetland scientists had in Florida to properly identify, understand, and use hydric soil indicators to identify those soils that fit both the hydric soil definition and the hydric soil criteria. The hydric soil indicators that properly identify soils that fit the definition and criteria in Florida are as follows: hydrogen sulfide, organic bodies, stratified layers, muck, mucky texture, dark surface, stripped matrix, redox concentrations, gleyed matrix, depleted matrix, iron manganese masses, umbric epipedon, thick mollic epipedon, or marl. Exact thicknesses, depths, percentages, and colors that are required for each of the hydric soil indicators have been developed. Because of the knowledge gained from intense observations of morphological features in soils for hydric soil determinations scientists were able to transfer this technological ability to include the estimation of seasonal high water tables for all soils in Florida.

   WATER-DEPTH TOLERANCE
AB The response of Sagittaria lancifolia to increased water depths of 7.5 and 15 cm was examined in this field study. Water-depth treatments were achieved by digging sods containing one or two individual plants or ramets of S. lancifolia from the marsh, removing sediment from the resulting hole, and replacing the sods in their original location at the appropriate lower elevation. Plants subjected to increased water depth of 15 cm had higher mean and maximum leaf heights than disturbed control plants. Aboveground biomass was not affected by water-depth treatment; however, 15-cm treatment plants had reduced root biomass and lowered leaf tissue concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn. Marsh sods at 15 cm below the marsh surface had the lowest redox potential and highest interstitial water sulfide concentration, indicating that this treatment created the most stressful belowground environment. Sagittaria lancifolia plants responded to the level of stress imposed by the experimental conditions with an altered growth form of increased leaf height.

AB Populations of American black ducks have declined and if has been hypothesized that wetland acidification, which can alter food quality by increasing availability of cadmium and decreasing that of calcium, may have contributed. We tested whether low-level cadmium and reduced calcium intake affect tissue cadmium concentrations and behaviour of captive black ducks. Adults received diets that mimicked cadmium and calcium concentrations in invertebrate prey from acid and from circumneutral wetlands for three spring and slimmer months in 1991 and 1992. Behaviours were monitored both when birds were fed experimental diets and control (commercial) diets. Cadmium in kidneys and liver differed significantly among groups and low calcium facilitated cadmium uptake. After two breeding seasons, levels of accumulated Cd were not lethal. However, birds that received Cd were significantly more active than control birds. Increased activity may have implications for survival of birds in the wild.

AB The effects of pH, potentially toxic metals, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on a freshwater, palustrine wetland assemblage (three amphibian species, one mosquito genus, and 18 genera of algae) were examined in 500 liter outdoor mesocosms. The design was fully factorial and exposure levels were set to represent concentrations that occur naturally in temporary ponds in central Pennsylvania, an acid-impacted region of the USA. Water chemistry was precisely regulated by use of an artificial pond water rather than using stream water or well water with partially unknown composition.
   Jefferson (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and spotted salamanders (A. maculatum) were negatively impacted by low pH and high metal concentrations. Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) were negatively impacted by high DOC and low pH. These negative effects included increased time to metamorphosis and decreased survival and wet body mass at metamorphosis. Mosquito emergence was unaffected by pH, metals, or DOG. All three abiotic factors (metals, pH, and DOG) interacted to determine algal taxonomic composition. Hence, abiotic conditions may determine amphibian reproductive success both directly and indirectly, via effects an algae, since a primary food source of salamanders, zooplankton, ave affected by changes in algal composition. These complex interactions should be considered in evaluating the possible toxicity of pond waters to fauna and flora. Until now, pH alone has been considered the primary limiting factor far amphibians breeding in temporary ponds.

AB Phytotoxicity data for aquatic plants have served a relatively minor role in regulatory decisions concerning the environmental hazard of most potential contaminants.  A variety of phytotoxicity tests have been conducted with freshwater green algae, duckweed, blue-green algae, diatoms and rooted macrophytes (whole plants and seeds).  Several test methods have been standardized for microalgae which are used primarily with chemicals, effluents, contaminated sediment elutriates and hazardous waste leachates.  Current scientific understanding concerning the phytotoxic effects of these contaminants is based mostly on results for a few green algae.  The greatest limitation of these results is their uncertain environmental relevance due to the large interspecific variation in response of standard algal test species and the unrealistic experimental test conditions.  Results of the few field validation toxicity tests conducted to resolve this uncertainty have been chemical-specific and unpredictable.
   Aquatic vascular plants have been used less frequently than algae as test species.  Duckweeds have been used more often than rooted submersed species but the uncertain nature of their sensitivities relative to animal and other plant species has limited their use.  Regulatory interest in wetland protection, contaminated sediment evaluations and sediment quality criteria development will result in increased use of whole rooted plants and their seeds as test species.  Overall, regardless of the test species, if phytotoxicity data are to be more available and effective in the hazard assessment process, additional information concerning species sensitivity, and environmental relevance of the results will be needed.

   FLUX AND SHORT-TERM SEDIMENTATION
SO WETLANDS

   STRUCTURES
AB The impact of two coastal Louisiana marsh management plans on water and materials flux, shortterm sedimentation, and several soil parameters was evaluated between May 1989 and January 1990. The study was carried out in the Fina-Laterre Marsh Management Area and the Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in managed and unmanaged areas. Water and material flux was measured each two hours during twelve 48 h flux studies, and net fluxes per m(2) of drainage area were calculated for water, total suspended sediments, salinity, NO3+NO2, PO4, and NH4. Short-term sedimentation was measured as the weight of material deposited over 2-4 week intervals on petri dishes placed on the marsh surface. The managed sites experienced considerable reductions in total water exchange, leading to reductions in net material exchanges. when expressed on a per m(2) basis, the managed wetlands are much less tightly coupled to the surrounding estuary compared to unmanaged areas. Within the context of a general decrease of exchange, the two managed areas on average export materials to the estuary. In the managed areas, the results suggest that management can lead to reduced salinity and a loss of sediments and nutrients. Short-term sedimentation was less at the managed areas; expressed as g m(-2)d(-1), total sedimentation rates were 0.57 for Fina managed, 1.02 for Fina unmanaged, 1.68 for Rockefeller managed, and 3.82 for Rockefeller unmanaged. Soil P was lower and soil organic matter was higher at the managed areas. Organic matter in the soil was low compared with recently deposited material, suggesting that most organic matter deposited on the surface of the marsh is lost through decomposition. Reduction of flooding during storm events is the likely mechanism leading to reduced sedimentation on the marsh surface in the managed areas.

AB During 1991 and 1992, we studied 92 wetlands, including open water (ponds) and emergent communities, created as a result of Wyoming Abandoned Mine Lands' (AML) reclamation efforts in northeast Wyoming. Through these activities, over 300 wetlands were filled, reclaimed, created, or otherwise modified. For mitigation purposes, wetlands to be filled or modified were first evaluated using a Wetland Habitat Value (WHV) Model. Using the model, wetland losses were mitigated by increasing the WHV of some wetlands or by creating new wetlands elsewhere. We evaluated model performance in offsetting wetland loss and how well the model predicted waterfowl use. We also compared post-reclamation wetland sizes to those predicted by engineering plans and submitted for Section 404 permit approval. In our study, predicted WHVs were overestimated at 100% of the wetlands for which pre-reclamation WHVs were available (n = 8). The most commonly overestimated variables were size, fraction of emergent cover, adjacent upland cover, and the number of bays and peninsulas. We obtained pre-construction size estimates for 64 of the original 80 wetlands. Fifty-five of 64 wetlands were smaller than pre-reclamation engineering goals. The WHV Model accurately predicted use of wetlands by migrating and breeding Canada geese (Branta canadensis), migrating dabbling ducks, and migrating diving ducks. Future users of the model must be careful not to overestimate results of planned mitigation efforts. Predicted size of constructed wetlands may be commonly overestimated; this possibility should be considered in mitigation plans, especially those involving wetland destruction.

AB Birds were surveyed during summer 1985 in five adjacent saline vegetation zones and during summers 1986 and 1991 in 6 adjacent vegetation zones on the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge on the upper Texas Coast. Although 66 bird species were recorded, numbers and species varied among years, and only 17 were nesting species. A few bird species used all vegetation types at some time, but most were limited by vegetation structure or water presence. Olney's three-square bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and mudflats were especially favored feeding and resting areas in response to periodic flooding and had the greatest frequency. of use as well as species richness. Reduced rainfall and water depths during 1986 were reflected in a change toward birds favoring drier conditions. Heavy rainfall in 1991 decreased diversity but increased usage and favored freshwater and swimming birds. Although tidally influenced wetlands often are considered uniform, dynamic water and salinity regimes observed along this coast must be considered in the design of any management or conservation program.

TI COMPOSITION OF SEED BANKS ALONG AN ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT IN PLAYA

DT Article
DE PLAYA; SEED BANK; SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS; WETLAND
AB We analyzed the composition of seed banks dong an elevational gradient (0-1 m) in playa wetlands of the Southern High Plains of Texas. Differing seed-bank composition along such a gradient may be one mechanism in the determination of vegetation structure in wetlands. We used the seedling-emergence technique under moist-soil and submerged treatments to ascertain the composition of seed banks in 8 playas. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in overall or common species seedling densities along the elevational gradient. Fluctuating water levels in a relatively shallow wetland, combined with the short linear distance of the gradient into a flat bottom, results in the uniform distribution of seed in playas. Additionally, wind action during periods when playas are dry may serve to distribute seeds throughout the wetland. Structure of vegetation in playas is determined principally by the varying soil moisture regime, which regulates composition of species germinating when other environmental conditions are suitable. When environmental conditions, including soil-moisture content, are appropriate for germination, each species in the seed bank could potentially be found throughout the wetland. When managing playas for specific plant species through manipulation of soil moisture, we can expect a comparable species response to similar treatments anywhere in the playa.

AB We examined the effects of sediment depth on emergence of seedlings from wetland seed banks, with the goal of understanding potential effects on wetlands of sediment runoff from agricultural fields. Seed germination was studied in the greenhouse using seed bank samples taken from natural wetlands in central Iowa, U.S.A. Sediment loads as low as 0.25 cm significantly reduced the number of species and total number of individuals recruited from seed bank samples. Addition of sediment decreased the number of individuals appearing for most, but not all; species. The change in number of seedlings that occurred in treatments with 1 cm of sediment cover was related to seed mass, with larger-seeded species showing the least effect of burial by sediment.

AB We examined the effects of burial by sediment on seed germination, seedling survival, growth of adults, and litter decomposition of cattail (Typha x glauca). Seed germination and seedling survival were studied in the greenhouse, while adult plant growth and litter decomposition were studied outdoors in 3-m-diameter experimental tanks (mesocosms) at the Iowa State University Experimental Wetlands Complex near Ames, IA. The effect of burial on litter decomposition was also examined in the field at the Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Project near Wadsworth, IL. Seed germination was decreased by 60-90% when sediment loads of 0.2 to 0.4 cm were applied to the surface of the soil. Seedling survivorship increased with increasing age and size of seedlings and decreased as sediment load increased from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. Sediment loads of 0, 1, 2, or 4 cm had no effect on adult plant density, number of leaves produced per plant, or leaf photosynthetic characteristics of plants grown in the mesocosms. Burial by sediment led to an initial decline in fate of cattail litter decay, for two months, but thereafter, rates for buried and unburied litter were similar. Small amounts of sediment had large effects on seed germination and growth of small seedlings, but adult plants and litter decomposition were largely unaffected by sediment.

AB Statistically sound comparisons of natural and constructed wetlands are complicated by variability between and within wetlands. This paper demonstrates the use of a SAS(R) program that estimates sampling effort and allocates that effort among number of wetlands, number of stations within wetlands, and number of samples to be collected at each station. Estimates are based upon variances known from pre-existing data, desired statistical power and critical effect, and project budget. The program is used to generate a sampling design for comparison of chironomid populations of natural and constructed freshwater herbaceous wetlands in central Florida.

Completed, ongoing, and preliminary studies conducted at Bog Run Bog, WV, Bog Lake Bog, MN, and Wetland 307 of the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario have included 1) a reciprocal transplant of dominant hummock and hollow Sphagnum species, examining growth in length, 2) a reciprocal transplant of peat, with periodic retrieval of transplanted samples and analysis of CO2 and CH4 production under anoxic and oxic conditions at held temperature and at 22 degrees C, 3) C-14-labeling of vegetation in hollow, hummock, and shrub plots, following the fate of a single day's photosynthetic fixation through aboveground and belowground components over time, and 4) a preliminary analysis of C-13 ratios in peat and of the CH4 that is produced and emitted. Collectively, these studies provide support for the premise that comparative studies of northern (cooler climate) and southern (warmer climate) peatland sites may provide insights into potential functional changes in boreal peatlands under predicted scenarios of global climate change.

DE FISHING SPIDER; DOLOMEDES TRITON; HABITAT USE; EVERGLADES
AB We investigated patterns of habitat use by adult fishing spiders Dolomedes triton in a seasonally dynamic freshwater wetland of the northern Everglades. Spiders were collected monthly (July 1990-January 1992) in adjacent wet prairie, alligator hole, and sawgrass habitats. Overall density of adult fishing spiders during the study period was 0.1 spiders per m(2), although there was extensive seasonal variation in abundance of these semi-aquatic arthropod predators. Densities were significantly higher in sawgrass stands than in wet prairies or alligator holes, which did not differ from one another. Sawgrass sites were characterized by shallower water depths, taller and denser canopy structure, more extensive litter deposits, and fewer potential avian and piscine predators. Overall, these data suggest that structural complexity and habitat heterogeneity influence the demographics of the fishing spider in this Everglades marsh system.

DE ACID MINE DRAINAGE; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; IRON OXIDES; SOIL COLOR
AB The relationship between soil color and iron oxide content in a surface-flow constructed wetland that successfully treats acid mine drainage (AMD) is examined with regard to its potential importance to wetland treatment of AMD. Twenty-one oxidized surficial soil samples (<5 cm depth) were collected along a 100-meter wetland transect and were characterized for Munsell color and iron oxide content. Soil color, expressed in terms of both a redness index as well as dominant wavelength, was found to be significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with iron oxide content. In addition, an apparent red-shift in soil color was observed from the wetland effluent toward the influent in response to increasing concentrations of iron in both the soil and the drainage water. If this relationship between soil color-iron oxide content-iron removal is shown to exist for other surface-flow AMD wetlands, evaluation of soil color can give a relatively quick and inexpensive estimate of iron retention for a given influent iron concentration entering a wetland.

AB A recently restored riparian wetland is being evaluated as a bioremediation site for nutrients moving downslope from an animal waste application site. in question is the short-term effectiveness of the restored wetland in enhancing the quality of the water leaving the site. Networks of shallow ground-water wells and surface runoff collectors are being used to monitor nutrient concentrations and nutrient assimilation as surface and ground water moves through the wetland. A 450-mm H-flume at the wetland outlet measures the quantity and quality of surface-water discharged from the wetland. Runoff is sampled at two locations entering the wetland and at two locations near the stream flow. At each location, the runoff is collected in a gutter, passed through a flume, and redistributed through a slotted gutter. Composite samples from each runoff event are collected with a low-cost automated sampler and analyzed for NO3-N, NH4-N, TKN, PO4-P, Total P, and Cl. Recorded hydrographs are used to determine total runoff volume and peak runoff rates of each runoff event. The runoff collectors have operated reliably and seem to be quantifying both hydrologic characteristics of runoff events and nutrient concentration changes in surface runoff as it migrates through the wetland. The simple design, low cost, and dependability of the runoff collection and automated sampling system make it suitable for a variety of research and industrial applications.

AB Herbivory and fire have been shown to affect the structure and composition of marsh communities. Because fire may alter plant species composition and cover, and these alterations may have an effect on herbivore populations or foraging patterns, an interactive effect of herbivory and fire may be expected. In this study, the effects of fire and vertebrate herbivory in a Louisiana oligohaline marsh were studied using small, controlled burns and animal exclosures. Mean total biomass was nearly 2 times greater in the plots protected from herbivory than in the plots subject to natural herbivory. Additionally, mean total biomass was over 1.5 times greater in the plots that remained unburned than in those that were burned. Two dominant perennial species, Spartina patens and Scirpus olneyi, were negatively affected by herbivory, but two annual sedges, Cyperus flavescens and Cyperus odorata, were positively affected. Burning reduced the aboveground biomass of Spartina patens and Bacopa monnieri. No species increased in biomass as a result of fire. No significant differences were found in species richness between herbivory treatments or between fire treatments. Although both herbivory and fire were found to cause significant changes in the vegetation, the interaction between herbivory and fire was not found to produce any significant effects in any test conducted.

AB We measured aquatic invertebrate abundance, standing stock biomass, and community production in three types of wetlands on Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge from December 1987 through April 1988. Together, Orthocyclops modestus and Daphnia pulex were the most abundant organisms collected in all habitats during both winter and spring, but each contributed little to total standing stock biomass or production. Caecidotea communis and Pristina osborni made up greater-than-or-equal-to 47% of the total standing stock biomass at each site during both winter (December-February) and spring (March-May). Crangonyx gracilis, Chironomus spp., Chaoborus punctipennis, and Eclipidrilus spp. each contributed greater-than-or-equal-to 5% of the total biomass at one or more wetland habitats. Estimates of aquatic invertebrate community production ranged from 930 to 1,578 mg dry weight/M2 among wetland types during winter and from 3,306 to 5,421 mg dry weight/m2 among wetland types during spring. Caecidotea communis and Pristina osborni contributed most to community production during both seasons, but particularly in beaver ponds during spring. Other taxa made up substantial portions of the community production in one or two wetland habitats.

AB The term ''value'' usually connotes something of use or desirable to Homo sapiens. Values ascribed to many wetlands include providing habitats for fishing, hunting, waterfowl, timber harvesting, wastewater assimilation, and flood control, to name a few. These perceived values arise directly from the ecological functions found within the wetlands. Ecosystem functions include hydrologic transfers and storage of water, biogeochemical transformations, primary productivity, decomposition, and community/habitat. An analysis of the relationship among wetland functions and values showed that over-utilization or intensive removal of wetland values (e.g., timber harvesting with drainage), can often result in a loss of specific wetland functions. An assessment procedure comparing changes in wetland function from both a disturbed and reference wetland was developed. This approach scales the wetland functions in a reference system to 100% and then compares the altered wetlands' functional response. Methods to analyze wetland functions in the field are outlined along with examples of the effects of forestry activities on wetland response.

   DEPOSITION
AB Southern forested wetlands perform two important biogeochemical functions on the landscape: 1) nutrient (N and P) removal from incident surface, subsurface, and ground waters, and 2) export of organic carbon and associated nutrients to aquatic ecosystems downstream. In addition to P sediment deposition, which can range from 1.6 to 36.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 P, denitrification of NO3-N (0.5 to 350 kg ha-1 yr-1) and P adsorption (130 to 199 kg ha-1 yr-1) can be important mechanisms associated with N and P removal, respectively. Biological processes, uptake by plants (15.0 to 51.8 kg ha-1 yr-1 for N; 0.2 to 3.8 kg ha-1 yr-1 for P) and microorganism absorption (16.2 to 87.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 for N; 6.6 to 40.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 for P) are also important and are intimately associated with organic matter export. Clearcut harvests (ground-based or aerial), followed by natural regeneration, are the most common silvicultural techniques used in forested floodplains in the South. Ground-based methods have been shown to increase soil bulk density and decrease hydraulic conductivity and redox potential in wetter soils. In addition to the increases in soil temperature and soil wetness that frequently occur following forest harvesting, these added effects may be responsible for the reduced productivity and altered species composition observed following ground-based vs. aerial harvests. Changes in denitrification will be a function of the degree to which harvesting affects soil redox potential, substrate (C) availability, and nitrate production. In theory, denitrification rates should increase following harvesting, but low nitrate availability in acid soils may limit this effect. The effects of harvesting on P adsorption processes in forested wetland soils have not been studied. Reductions in plant uptake and litterfall and changes in species composition following harvesting could alter both nutrient retention/transformation and organic C export functions. On wetter sites, canopy removal may stimulate algal populations, providing a short-term mechanism for conserving geochemical exports. Clearcut harvest systems that minimize alterations in soil hydrology and promote rapid vegetation regrowth should have the least effect on biogeochemical functions in southern forested wetlands.

The review summarized results from nine wetland forests in five states (AL, FL, MI, NC, and SC). Silvicultural practices assessed were timber harvesting (including thinning and clearcutting), site preparation, bedding, planting, drainage, and fertilization. Many of the studies reviewed observed increased concentrations of suspended sediment and nutrients following silvicultural operations when compared with undisturbed controls. Water quality criteria were rarely exceeded by silvicultural operations, however, and effects on water quality were transient. Water quality parameters returned to undisturbed levels within, a period ranging from months to several years.

AB In the interest of increasing productivity of forested wetlands for timber production and/or wildlife value, management schemes that deal mainly with water-level control have been developed. The three forest types in the southeastern U.S. most commonly affected are cypress/tupelo forests, bottomland hardwood forests, and wet pine sites (including pocosins). In forested wetlands, hydrology is the most important factor influencing productivity. In bottomland and cypress/tupelo forests, water-level control can have mixed results. Alterations in natural hydrologic patterns leading to increased flooding or drainage can cause decreased growth rates or even death of the forest. Bottomland hardwoods respond favorably in the short term to water-level management, but the long-term response is currently under study. In wet pine sites, timber volume can be increased significantly by water-level management, but the impact upon other ecological functions is less understood. It is difficult to adequately describe productivity relations in wetland forests because of the great diversity in habitat types and the lack of data on how structure and function might be affected by forestry operations. There is a definite need for more long-term, regional studies involving multidisciplinary efforts.

DE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS; FORESTED WETLANDS; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB ''Cumulative impact,'' the incremental effect of an impact added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future impacts, was reviewed as it pertains to southern forested wetlands. In the U.S., the largest losses of forested wetlands between the 1970s and 1980s occurred in southeastern states that had the most bottomland hardwood to begin with: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These losses were due primarily to forestry and agriculture. Other sources of cumulative impact include decrease in average area of individual wetlands, shift in proportion of wetland types, change in spatial configuration of wetlands, and loss of cumulative wetland function at the landscape scale. For two wetland-related functions, flood flow and loading of suspended solids, watersheds that contained less than 10% wetlands were more sensitive to incremental loss of wetland area than were watersheds with more than 10% wetlands. The relative position of wetlands within a drainage network also influenced their cumulative function. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are becoming an important tool for evaluating cumulative impacts and their effects.

DE POCOSIN; PINE PLANTATIONS; FOREST MANAGEMENT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION;
   DRAINMOD MODELING; PEAT MINING; AGRICULTURE
AB Land development activities such as agriculture, clear cutting, peat mining, and the planting of forest plantations on wetlands can affect the hydrologic behavior of these ecosystems by affecting their water storage and release patterns on the landscape. The effects of these development activities on hydrologic fluxes in peatlands (Typic Medisaprists) were compared to the effects of forest management practices in North Carolina using a field-tested hydrologic simulation model (DRAINMOD). Simulations revealed that natural peat-based (Histosol) pocosin systems lose 66% (80 cm) of the 123 cm of average annual rainfall by evapotranspiration (ET) and 34% (42 cm/yr) via annual runoff. Annual runoff values were 63 cm/yr for peat mining areas, 48 cm/yr for cleared peatlands, 46 cm/yr for peatlands converted to agriculture and 34 cm/yr for pine plantations, once the forest canopy is closed. Thus, these wetland alterations, except for forestry, significantly increased runoff and decreased ET compared to the natural ecosystem. Forest pine plantation management decreased runoff and increased ET. A case study of the effects of forest management practices was reviewed for a 15-year-old drained loblolly pine plantation growing on fine sandy loam soils (Thermic Typic umbraquults) in the coastal plains of North Carolina. Forestry activities such as thinning (i.e., reduced leaf area index by 50%) decreased ET and canopy interception and nearly doubled drainage loss (38 cm/yr to 60 cm/ yr). Commonly applied forest practices, such as drainage, increased the average number of flow events with flows > 5 mm/day to 86 days per year from 26 days per year under natural conditions.

AB In Florida, phosphate mining companies that destroy natural wetlands are required to construct mitigation wetlands. Comparisons of plant communities are frequently used to determine the degree to which constructed wetlands mimic natural wetlands, but efforts to address similarity based on fauna are rare. Studies in lake littoral zones suggest that meiobenthic cladocerans possess characteristics that may make their use in wetland comparisons advantageous. In this study, meiobenthic cladocerans were sampled from 8 natural freshwater wetlands and 11 freshwater wetlands constructed on phosphate-mined lands. The pulsed nature of the cladoceran communities limits their value as a quantitative measure of the similarity of natural and constructed wetlands. Qualitative analyses based on the presence or absence of species suggest that cladoceran assemblages of some constructed wetlands mimic those of some natural wetlands, but the range of assemblages found in constructed wetlands is narrower than that found in natural wetlands.

Egg deposition by R. sylvatica was correlated positively with pond volume (1991-R, 1992R) and dissolved organic carbon (1991-R). Three days following a rain event of 1.9 cm in April, 1991, the pH in four of nine ponds was significantly lower than three and five days prior to the rainfall. There were differences among some of the three regions in pond pH, [K], [Ca], [Al], [ortho-Pi] [dissolved organic carbon], alkalinity, [Zn], volume, and the number of egg masses of R. sylvatica and A. maculatum, suggesting that temporary ponds are rather heterogeneous in their abiotic and biotic characteristics. There are landscape scale patterns (ridge, valley, plateau) that are especially deserving of additional study. Amphibian breeding success in temporary ponds of central Pennsylvania can be predicted in part by abiotic conditions such as pH, [Al], [total cations], [dissolved organic carbon], [Si], and pond volume. Further work is needed to determine which of these variables are causally linked to amphibian breeding and why there is variation among sites and years in the degree of correlation among abiotic and biotic variables.

AB Relationships between morphological, physiographic, and hydrologic features of La Mancha wetlands and their origin and functioning are studied. Wetlands size and density are primarily limited by drainage density, which is directly related to altitude. Broad genetic types of basins (deflation, fluvial, differential erosion, tectonic, solution basins) may be described in terms of depth and size. Wetland morphology contributes to the determination of the hydrologic regime, but large water inputs and human activities often modify this influence. Integrated genetic and functional trends are deduced from these characteristics. Discriminant analysis reveals that physical descriptors of wetlands can be used to model the spatial expression of those trends in terms of the already existing broad general knowledge on geology, surface- and groundwater hydrology, and geomorphology.

AB We collected aquatic macroinvertebrates in a seasonal, semipermanent, and permanent pothole wetland in southwestern Manitoba, Canada to determine their abundance and distribution following drought in relation to the prelaying, egg-laying and brood-rearing periods of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). We collected 26 taxa of nektonic macroinvertebrates of which 6 major groups (Cladocera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Culicidae, Dytiscidae, Gastropoda) collectively comprised >98% of the total number of individuals. The number of nektonic macroinvertebrates peaked during the egg-laying period, and crustaceans were the most abundant taxa in all 3 potholes during all 3 breeding periods. We collected 50 families of emergent insects and several unknown families in the orders Coleoptera and Diptera. Five major groups (Chironomidae, Culicidae, other Diptera, Coleoptera, Leptoceridae) collectively comprised >97% of the total number. Insect emergence increased during the breeding season to a peak during the brood-rearing period. Chironomids were the most abundant emergent insect during all 3 breeding periods and were most abundant in the permanent pothole. Chironomids collected on artificial substrates also were most abundant in the permanent pothole during all 3 breeding periods. The number of gastropods was greatest during the laying and brood-rearing periods. Following drought, it appeared that macroinvertebrates were abundant and widely distributed in the 3 potholes.

SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE WATER BALANCE; CLIMATE WARMING; MATHEMATICAL MODEL; JAMES BAY
AB The present study investigates the potential impacts of climate warming on the water balance and vegetation patterns in a coastal wetland ecosystem on James Bay, Canada. The study illustrates some of the linkages within this system and how they might respond to a change in mean summer temperature. These linkages are outlined in a simple conceptual model with hydrology, salinity, topography, and vegetation distribution components. The model includes two feedbacks: a vegetation/evaporation feedback, and a hydrologic, runoff/storage feedback. A mathematical model is developed to examine changes in evaporation and water balance under a range of temperature change scenarios.
   Although the model is relatively insensitive to the internal feedbacks, model runs for temperature-change scenarios of +2 to +8 degrees C above present summertime normal showed evaporation increased by 18 to 64%, respectively, which resulted in decreases in wetland water table of 40 to 129% below the normal summer drawdown. These changes in basin storage significantly affect the distribution of woody species in the wetland. The basin area inhabited by woody species increased from the present 25% to 32% for a +2 degrees C temperature change and to 51% for a +8 degrees C change. Increased stomatal resistance of the wetland vegetation, which might result from increased CO, concentrations, partially offsets the evaporation enhancement from warmer summer temperatures.

AB A beaver pond and its associated inlet and outlet waters in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were monitored for major chemical solutes for 26 months in an effort to quantify underlying chemical controls on the production and consumption of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). The pond was a net annual sink for inlet Al, SO42-, NO3-, and H4SiO4. The pond was a net annual source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+, and Fe2+. Losses of ANC resulting from Al and basic cation retention, as well as organic anion release (RCOO-) associated with DOC, were more than offset by SO42- and NO3- retention and Fe2+ and NH4+ release, resulting in a net production of ANC. Rates of ANC generation were 120 meg m(-2)yr(-1) and 310 meg m-2yr(-1), respectively (based on pond surface area), for the non-summer (October-June) and summer (July-September) periods. Seasonal variations in ANC in the outlet stream were largely associated with Fe2+ and DOC release, while ANC in the upland inlet stream was associated with Al, NO3-, and basic cations, with much less seasonal variation. Controls on stream chemistry were temporally and longitudinally different for the inlet and outlet streams. The shift to seasonal control of outlet stream ANC by processes associated with organic matter decomposition reactions and anaerobic zone nutrient transformations may be characteristic of headwater wetlands in temperate zones with seasonal temperature extremes. Beaver impoundments and wetlands may also be important in the upstream mobilization or retention of geologically bound solutes like Al, Fe, and H4SiO4. Headwater wetlands, as sinks for solutes associated with acidic deposition and watershed acidification (i.e., SO42-, NO3-, and Al), may play a role in the amelioration of the effects of these solutes on downstream receiving waters and associated biota. Depending on their location in relation to drainage patterns, these ponded systems may influence the nutrient dynamics of receiving waters through nitrogen transformations and organic carbon cycling.

AB Photosynthetic and growth responses of Spartina pectinata were compared in annually and biennially burned wetlands in a northeastern Kansas tallgrass prairie. Photosynthetic CO2 uptake was consistently higher in Spartina pectinata in annually burned wetlands, and there was a seasonal difference in maximum photosynthetic rates. Plants in annually burned wetlands reached a maximum photosynthetic rate of 38.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in late spring, while maximum photosynthesis in plants of biennially burned wetlands was 28.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in late summer. Culm density in these wetlands was not affected by fire; however, aboveground biomass production, inflorescence density and plant height at anthesis were significantly greater in annually burned wetlands. These results indicate that Spartina pectinata may be a fire-dependent species, with post-fire responses similar to the dominant grasses in tallgrass prairie as well as other Spartina congeners.

AB Maximum aquatic macroinvertebrate density and biomass was 1600 and 4700 individuals/m(2) and 9 and 20 g/m(2) dry weight, respectively, in two Mississippi River black willow (Salix nigra) floodplain wetlands, in northeastern Missouri. Density was lower than in seasonally flooded marshes and other forested wetlands characterized by dynamic hydrology. Biomass was comparable to that reported in other studies. Maximum density and biomass of invertebrates occurred in late spring, 6 to 8 months following flooding, when water level was between 11 and 20 cm. Taxonomic composition was similar to that in other detrital based, forested wetlands and was dominated by crustaceans (Isopoda and Amphipoda), mollusks (Pelecypoda and Gastropoda), chironomids, and oligochaetes. Because study sites were deeply flooded (50-120 cm) during waterfowl migration, invertebrates were unavailable to dabbling ducks during fall, winter, and early spring.

DE REMOTE SENSING; WETLANDS; WEEDS; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; LYTHRUM-SALICARIA
AB Purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria, is an exotic plant that has proven to be extremely competitive with native wetland and riparian zone species. Current control measures are limited and most effective when infestations are detected at an early stage. The goal of this project was to provide a detection tool (remote sensing) for relatively small loosestrife infestations. Small format (35 mm) aerial photography was acquired over seven sites in central Washington during the peak bloom period of L. salicaria. The sites were selected to provide a variety of typical background plants and a range of infestation sizes, from a few isolated individuals to large, monospecific stands. All sites were photographed at approximately 1:5000 (large) and 1:12,000 (small) scale with Fuji Velvia 50 and Kodak Kodachrome 64 color transparency films. Sixteen sample slides were ranked by 46 interpreters according to the ease of finding loosesuife flowers. As expected, the interpreters ranked massive loosestrife stands as the most easy to identify. However, a large scale image of single loosestrife flowers was ranked almost as easy to interpret as the high altitude imagery of massive stands. Loosestrife was most difficult to detect on imagery from sites with few loosestrife plants or with large amounts of dead plant material below the flower heads. Differences in film type were significant, ranking in order of decreasing ease of interpretation: Fuji > Ektachrome > Kodachrome. Remote sensing using small format aerial photography can be successfully applied to discriminate flowering loosestrife plants from other background wetland vegetation. Color slide transparencies taken at 1:5000 or larger scale can show flowers in sufficient detail for detection and mapping of isolated plants. Screening of interpreters can enhance the probability of proper interpretation and detection. Fuji Velvia 50 or other films that provide greater saturation of green colors can offer an advantage in detection.

DE CREATED WETLANDS; VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT; SEED INTRODUCTION;
   COLONIZATION; WISCONSIN
AB We examined the natural colonization by vascular plants of 11 created wetlands in southeastern Wisconsin. The wetlands studied were small depressional wetlands that were isolated from other wetland sites. Wetlands were sampled over a two-year period, providing samples of wetlands aged one to three years. The development of wetland vegetation in these 11 naturally colonized sites was compared to that in five wetlands to which we introduced 22 species of native wetland plants. We identified 142 species of vascular plants in the naturally colonized wetlands. Of these, 82 (58%) were native, obligate or facultative wetland plants. The diversity and richness of native wetland plants and the proportion of total plant cover that was comprised of native wetland species increased from one-to three-year-old wetlands. The diversity and richness of native wetland species increased with wetland age, wetland size, and with proximity to the nearest established wetland. Distance to the nearest seed source had a particularly strong effect on the number of native wetland species present. Cattail (Typha spp.) accounted for 15% of the cover of native wetland species in one-year-old wetlands; this increased to 55% in three-year-old wetlands. We predict that the naturally colonized wetlands will develop into near monocultures of cattail with a fringe of willows (Salix spp.) and cottonwood (Populus deltoides) at the wetland/upland margin. Wetlands seeded with native wetland species had much higher diversity and richness of native wetland species than unseeded wetlands after two years. Seventeen of the 22 seeded species became established in at least two wetlands after simple introduction of seed to the sites. Cattail cover after two years was lower in seeded sites, both as an absolute cover and as a proportion of native wetland plant cover. Early introduction of a diversity of wetland plants may enhance the long-term diversity of vegetation in created wetlands.

AB Research in southern Louisiana over the last decade indicates that large expanses of mudflats are being maintained in an unvegetated state primarily by the rodent nutria (Myocastor coypus). At present, there is a dearth of work on managing wetlands in the presence of intense herbivory. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the potential in wetlands restoration of Justicia lanceolata, a wetland plant that is resistant to herbivory by nutria. Results from a previous study indicate that J. lanceolata is effective at trapping sediments. Furthermore, once it is established and islet elevations are built up, J. lanceolata is readily outcompeted by other species of wetland vegetation.
   Results from this study indicate that J. lanceolata has several other properties that render it amenable for use in marsh restoration in the southeastern region of the USA: (1) thousands of propagules can be obtained from a single J. lanceolata islet without mortality to the adult plants; (2) it is resistant to herbivory, perhaps to the extent of being a herbivore repellent; (3) it is resilient with respect to saline storm surges, particularly if followed by a freshwater flushing event; (4) it is well-adapted to flooded conditions.

DE CREATED WETLANDS; DELINEATION; INDICATOR STATUS; SECTION-404; WEIGHTED
   AVERAGE; WETLANDS
AB Forested wetland creation for compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is increasing dramatically throughout the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. However, no quantitative data are available regarding the effectiveness of past forested wetland creation efforts in this region, and no quantitative assessment techniques for evaluating success have been developed. Created wetlands may lack sufficient time for soil formation; however, colonizing vegetation and hydrology may be considered indicators of existing conditions. Hydrology monitoring is expensive, time-consuming, and highly variable over short time periods. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that one parameter (vegetation) could be used to evaluate early site conditions following wetland creation. We attempt to show the advantages and disadvantages of using vegetation to calculate percentage ''wetland'' and ''upland'' as an early monitoring tool. Calculations were made using the 1989 Federal Manual for Identification and Delineation of Jurisdictional Wetlands, colonizing vegetation weighted average, site moisture estimates, and comparisons with an adjacent reference wetland. Percentage ''wetland'' and ''upland'' estimates were similar whether vegetation alone or vegetation in combination with hydrology was used in calculations. Vegetation colonizing the site may respond to both soil and hydrology and may provide an early indication of conditions within created wetlands. The findings of this study suggest that calculating plot-weighted averages and comparison with pre-impact wetland vegetation (or an adjacent reference wetland) may be a useful component of a monitoring scheme for certain created wetlands.

DE BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY; CENTRARCHIDAE; SALINITY; WETLANDS
AB Salinity preferences of juvenile bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) from a freshwater pond in north-eastern Mississippi and a brackish bayou in coastal Mississippi held at 0 parts per thousand were tested at 26.5 +/- 1.0-degrees-C in salinity-gradient chambers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 parts per thousand) under a 12L:12D photoperiod cycle. Juvenile bluegill from both sites did not show any statistically significant preference for any of the salinity options and were not significantly different from controls. These data suggest that juvenile bluegill from either locale fail to show any differential short-term (1.5 h) behavioral effects that might influence their perception and use of saline habitats. These data and data from previous studies suggest that bluegill are better able to physiologically and behaviorally tolerate elevated salinity relative to other centrarchids, particularly Micropterus spp.

AB We compared the breeding bird communities of natural and recently restored prairie potholes in northern Iowa in 1989 and 1990. Species richness of breeding birds was higher (P < 0.05) at natural wetlands, although duck pair counts and species richness were not significantly different between wetland types (P > 0.1). Common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris), and swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) were each more abundant at natural than at restored wetlands during at least one year (P < 0.05). Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized a significantly greater proportion of red-winged blackbird nests at natural than at restored wetlands. Incomplete development of typical vegetation structure evidently depresses bird species richness at recently restored prairie potholes. Drought the year before and during the first year of our study undoubtedly affected our results. Similar studies should be conducted during periods of relatively high precipitation to complement our results.

DE BOG-FEN GRADIENT; HYDROLOGY; NORTH-CAROLINA; NUTRIENTS; PEATLANDS;
   POCOSINS
AB Soil chemistry and hydrology gradients are closely associated with and have often been cited as the causative agents for changes in wetland plant community composition. We analyzed the biogeochemistry and hydrology of three freshwater peatland communities on the North Carolina Coastal Plain-short pocosins, tall pocosins, and gum swamps. We compare this community gradient to the classical bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands. Short pocosins, in the ombrotrophic center of the raised bog complex, have the highest summer water table, with a large part of the peat profile remaining anaerobic throughout the year. They are highly nutrient-deficient with low levels of total and extractable P, N, and basic cations. They additionally have the greatest peat depth, with an organic matter content of ca. 95%. Tall pocosins have a highly seasonal water table, shallower peat depth, low soil nutrient levels, and an average soil organic matter content from 76 to 93% in the top 30 cm. Gum swamp forests have a highly seasonal water table and the shallowest peat depth. They are the most minerotrophic community, based on low organic matter and high N and P content of the soil, but have low levels of exchangeable Ca and Mg and low percent base saturation. All communities had low soil pH (< 4). Short pocosins and tall pocosins were effectively differentiated by seasonal hydrology and peat depth but not by soil characteristics, while the pocosins and swamp forest had large differences in seasonal hydrology, peat depth, percent organic matter, and soil nutrients.
   This community gradient contrasts sharply with the bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands, in which there is an increase in soil pH, basic cations, percent base saturation, and ash content, and a decrease in extractable N, P, and K. This biogeographical comparison suggests a need for further study of the nutrients likely to control plant growth in peatlands (i.e., P, N, and K), in addition to the historical emphasis on basic cations and pH.

AB Although the Belding's Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi) is listed as endangered in California, little is known about the factors that affect its abundance and distribution. Numbers of breeding pairs, nesting territory sizes, and vegetation characteristics were measured at fourteen study plots in two southern California coastal wetlands, Tijuana Estuary and Los Penasquitos Lagoon. Sparrows nested in middle salt marsh habitat in areas of dense pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) or saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). No nesting territories were found in transitional upland or low marsh habitat. Territory sizes were highly variable and significantly larger at Tijuana Estuary. Territory size may be related to nest site availability and water levels at time of establishment. More research is needed on the effects of habitat quality on reproductive success and territory size.

SO WETLANDS

DE FLOODING; LYTHRUM-SALICARIA; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; VEGETATION MANAGEMENT
AB Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is a nuisance exotic species that displaces native plants and has little value as food or habitat for wildlife. Attempts to control adult plants have had limited success. We investigated the effects of shallow flooding (< 30 cm) on the growth and survival of purple loosestrife seedlings. Pots containing purple loosestrife seedlings were assigned to each of 12 treatment combinations: 3 seedling height categories and 4 flooding depths. Mean stem densities were not affected by the treatments (P > 0.05). The flooding treatments significantly affected mean stem heights, but there were no identifiable trends within size classifications. All seedlings continued to grow during the experiment. The survival of any purple loosestrife plants can have serious implications in wetlands. The results from this study indicate that shallow flooding is not an effective approach to limiting or preventing establishment of purple loosestrife seedlings.

TI CHANGES IN THE FUNCTIONING OF WETLANDS ALONG ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; LANDSCAPE CONTINUA; LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE;
   NONPOINT SOURCE; STREAM HYDROLOGY; STREAM ORDER; WATER QUALITY
AB One of the prevalent gradients in wetlands is the continuum of depth and frequency of flooding. While much emphasis has been placed on the importance of hydrology as a driving force for wetlands, few other perspectives have emerged to demonstrate unifying patterns and principles. In contrast to the wetness continuum, the functioning of wetlands can be separated into two broad categories: (1) landscape-based transitions that occur within a wetland or group of similar wetland types and (2) resource-based transitions that allow comparisons of the flow of water and processing of nutrients among very different wetland types. Landscape-based continua include the transition from upstream to downstream in riverine wetlands and between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems within a wetland. Along the upstream-downstream continuum, sources of flood-water delivery change dominance from ground-water discharge and overland runoff, as in low order streams, to dominance by overbank flooding, as in high order streams. With increasing size, properties related to the aquatic-to-terrestrial transition are replaced by properties related to wetland-atmospheric exchanges and by landscape maintenance, the latter not normally acknowledged as a wetland function. Resource-based continua include the extremes of (1) sources of water to wetlands (precipitation, overland flow, and ground water) and (2) the variation in inflows and outflows of nutrients and sediments. Emphasis on water source forces consideration of controls beyond the wetland's boundaries. A broader view of biogeochemical functioning is gained by categorizing wetlands into groups based on the exchange of nutrients and sediments among landscape units rather than on serving as a sink or source for a particular element. Based on this analysis, the less frequently flooded or saturated portions of wetlands are no less functionally active than wetter portions; the functions are simply different. Efforts to classify wetlands according to their hydroperiod do little to reveal their fundamental properties.

TI EFFECT OF FORESTED WETLANDS ON NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUND-WATER
   AND SURFACE-WATER ON THE DELMARVA PENINSULA
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
DE WATER QUALITY; FORESTED WETLANDS; HYDROLOGY
AB The Delmarva Peninsula is an extensively farmed region in which nitrate from commercial fertilizers and poultry has entered the ground water and streams. The peninsula contains forested wetlands in a variety of settings, and their size and location are a result of the surrounding hydrologic and soil conditions. Three regions, here referred to as hydrogeomorphic regions, were selected for study. Each region has characteristic geologic and geomorphic features, soils, drainage patterns, and distribution of farmland, forests, and forested wetlands. In all three regions, forested wetlands generally occupy poorly drained areas whereas farmlands generally occupy well-drained areas. The three hydrogeomorphic regions studied are the well-drained uplands, the poorly drained uplands, and the surficial-confined region. The well-drained uplands have the largest amount of farmland and the smallest amount of forested wetlands of the three regions; here the forested wetlands are generally restricted to narrow riparian zones. The poorly drained uplands contain forested wetlands in headwater depressions and riparian zones that are interspersed among well-drained farmlands. The surficial-confined region has the smallest amount of farmland and largest amount of forested wetlands of the three regions studied. Wetlands in this region occupy the same topographic settings as in the poorly drained uplands. Much of the farmland in the surficial-confined region was previously wetland. Nitrate concentrations in ground water and surface water on the peninsula range widely, and their distribution reflects (1) the interspersion of forests among farmland, (2) hydrogeologic conditions, (3) types of soils, and (4) the ground-water hydrology of forested wetlands. The well-drained uplands had higher median nitrate concentrations in ground water than the poorly drained uplands or the surficial-confined region. The highest nitrate concentrations were in oxic parts of the aquifer, which are beneath well-drained soils that are farmed. and the lowest were in anoxic parts of the aquifer, which are beneath poorly drained soils overlain by forested wetlands. The effect of forested wetlands on water quality depends on the hydrogeologic conditions, extent of farming, and type of soils. The three regions contain differing combinations of these factors and thus are useful for isolating the effects of forested wetlands on water quality.

AB We: 1) quantified the areal extent of wetlands by type in Caroline County, VA to estimate the relative importance of non-tidal palustrine forested wetlands as a component of the wetland resources in Virginia's mid-Atlantic coastal plain, 2) used a comparative literature review to identify factors that might be important in controlling P retention in these wetlands, and 3) evaluated three indices that have been used to compare P adsorption potentials in wetland soils. Non-tidal palustrine forested wetlands comprised 66.0% of the 11,372 ha of wetlands in Caroline Co. The majority were either seasonally (4000 ha) or temporarily (1596 ha) flooded wetlands dominated by broad-leaved deciduous species. These wetlands are both small (averaging 5.4 and 2.4 ha in area, respectively) and numerous in this region. Adsorption by Al and Fe (hydr)oxides and precipitation of Al, Fe, and Ca phosphates probably controls dissolved phosphate retention and long-term P storage in these wetlands, although P storage in the woody biomass of aggrading forests may also be important. Phosphorus adsorption isotherms, a single-point phosphorus adsorption index, and concentrations of oxalate-extractrable (noncrystalline) Al and Fe have all been used as comparative indices of P sorption potentials in wetland soils, although the latter may represent the best single index of P sorption capacity because of its direct relationship to the mechanisms controlling P adsorption in soil. When using these indices to compare wetland P sorption potentials, it is important to consider differences in soil depth, profile heterogeneity, and bulk density between sites. Actual amounts of phosphate retained by a wetland will also be influenced by the degree of phosphate loading it receives, as determined by hydrology, phosphate sources in the watershed, and the P sorption potentials of surrounding upland soils. Because of the low P sorption potentials of sandy soils in coastal plain uplands, non-tidal palustrine forested wetlands in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain may perform particularly important functions with respect to dissolved phosphate removal and retention on the landscape.

DE FORESTED WETLANDS; VIRGINIA; SEDIMENTATION; TRACE ELEMENTS; TREE RINGS;
   WETLAND TRAPPING FUNCTION; DENDROGEOMORPHOLOGY
AB The Chickahominy River, arising near Richmond, Virginia, flows southeast toward Newport News, which impounds the river for much of its water supply. Much of the bottomland between the two cities is flooded for extended periods annually. Sediment-deposition rates estimated from tree rings were used in conjunction with multi-element analyses of sediments and of selected growth rings from oak trees to estimate amounts of trapped sediment and trace elements. Mean rates of deposition at eight study sites range from 0.7 to 5.7 mm/yr and are related to stream gradient, stream power, percent wetland, hydroperiod, and land use. Deposition rates are highest downstream from the confluence of upper basin tributaries near Richmond, where stream power is low and there is a high percentage of emergent/shrub-scrub wetlands; rates decrease along downstream reaches toward the Chickahominy reservoir. Tree-ring data suggest that mean sedimentation rates were greater during the last 50 years than during the previous 30-year period, possibly because of urban expansion in the upper basin. Sites nearest the urban area have the highest rates of sedimentation and the highest concentrations of most trace elements in sediments. Trace elements concentrated in sediment include zinc, lead, chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and cadmium. Concentrations in tree rings of zinc, copper, nickel, and lead were generally proportional to those in sediment at a site, and some inter-site correlations were also observed. Unusually high concentrations of zinc were detected in some tree rings, including some that formed before 1950. Concentrations of zinc and lead in the most recently formed rings of those trees suggest that sediment concentrations of those elements may have declined relative to earlier periods. The trapping of substantial amounts of sediment and trace elements by these forested wetlands demonstrates their importance in the maintenance of water-quality.

AB The Chickahominy River drains 790 km2 in southeastern Virginia, including approximately 155 kM2  of dense commercial, industrial, and urban development in the upper basin near Richmond, Virginia. Previous studies have shown that total stream concentrations of trace metals and nutrients increased during storms, suggesting resuspension of contaminated sediments and (or) stormwater influxes of pollutants. The possible role of wetlands in maintaining water quality is of concern because the river furnishes about 46 percent of the water supply for the City of Newport News. Particle sizes of sediments and their corresponding total concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc were determined to assess their distribution within wetlands adjacent to the river. Except for Zn, concentrations of all measured constituents in the <63-mum-particle fraction were lower downstream of Richmond, suggesting that most contaminants are retained in the upper basin. Zinc concentrations increased along downstream reaches, peaking at 5 1 0 mg kg-1 approximately 8 km below the confluence of Upham Brook with the Chickahominy River. Lead concentrations up to 192 mg kg-1 were measured in sediments along Upham Brook near Richmond. Concentrations of Zn and Cu were highest in streambed sediments and lowest in elevated forested wetlands. The results suggest that the developing regions of the basin have a significant effect on sediment chemistry within the basin and that wetlands play a role in retaining these sediment-borne contaminants in upper reaches of the basin. Studies are underway to assess the stablity of these sediments and the capacity of these contaminated wetlands to continue to assimilate them.

DE ALLOCATION; BELOWGROUND; FORESTED WETLAND; HYDROLOGY; HYDROPERIOD;
   PRODUCTION
AB Belowground processes in forested wetland ecosystems are exceptionally important, yet most attention seems to focus on surface flooding regimes and other aboveground features of these systems. Field studies in the Dismal Swamp and several manipulative experiments examined belowground dynamics in relation to a flood intensity gradient. Generally, more extensive flooding results in less production allocation belowground. Erroneous conclusions regarding wetland production are reached if aboveground parameters alone are considered. Root decomposition rates are slowest where the duration of soil saturation is the longest. Organic accumulation rates in wetlands are determined by the amount of production of particular biomass types (eg., leaves vs. roots) and the rate at which they decompose. Biomass allocation patterns seem to change in response to a flooding gradient. This represents a major implication for wetland ecosystem functions, as carbon allocation patterns determine the array of litter types that affect decomposition rates and thus nutrient availability. The hydroperiod data from the Dismal Swamp demonstrate the highly variable nature of flooding in forested wetlands, especially during the growing season. The data suggest that it is unwise to rely on hydroperiod as a direct criterion for identifying a jurisdictional wetland.

AB Nineteen mature Atlantic white-cedar swamps, located in four categories of undeveloped and suburban watersheds of the New Jersey Pinelands, were studied to determine the relationship between perturbations of water quality and hydrology and changes in species composition and community structure. Rank-orders of the 19 sites were compared for key variables (ground-water and surface-water NH4 and PO4, mean water-table level and water-table range). Rank orders for the sites were different for the various parameters, suggesting little congruence among water quality and hydrologic changes at wetlands within urban basins. Changes in species composition, measured as the number of invading species, were correlated with the number of perturbed chemical and hydrologic parameters and were not related to the absolute magnitude of any one parameter. Sites in developed watersheds supported a larger fraction of facultative upland and upland species than did sites in undisturbed watersheds: this change could affect wetland delineation of urban wetlands. Urbanization thus increases variability in environmental quality among sites of a given type of wetland and fosters an increase in proportion of non-hydrophytic vegetation within such wetlands.

AB We evaluate the effect of different capture techniques on estimates of species richness and diversity for several amphibian, reptile, and small mammal communities in saturated forested wetlands in southeastern Virginia and South Carolina. Each technique yields different and biased quantitative results because of variation in catchability within and among taxonomic groups. Drift fences with pitfall traps seem to be a useful technique for most taxa, but complete inventories require supplemental methods. Standardized arrays of coverboards in saturated forested wetlands may be useful only for specific taxa. Our ability to generalize about the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities and their value in saturated forested wetlands is limited because current data sets were obtained with different capture techniques. We recommend that standardized techniques and sampling efforts be used in future assessments of vertebrate communities in saturated forested wetlands so that comparisons can be made across time and space.

Loss of small wetlands resulted in total wetland area declining by 19% (from 2032 to 1655 ha), total wetland number declining by 62% (from 354 to 136 wetlands), and average inter-wetland distance increasing by 67% (from 0.6 to 1.0 km). Also, average upland-wetland proximity decreased by 50% (0.5 to. 1.0 km), such that just 54% of the landscape was within the maximum migration distance (1000 m) of terrestrial-dwelling and aquatic-breeding amphibians after loss of small wetlands, versus 90% before loss. A spatially-structured demographic model revealed that local populations of turtles, small birds, and small mammals, stable under conditions of no wetland loss, faced a significant risk of extinction (P > 5%) after loss of small wetlands. No change in metapopulation extinction risk was evident for salamanders or frogs, largely because high rates of population increase buffered these taxa against local extinction. These results suggest that small wetlands play a greater role in the metapopulation dynamics of certain taxa of wetland animals than the modest area comprised by small wetlands might imply.

DT Article
DE DISTURBANCE; DRAWDOWN; GLEASONIAN MODEL; PLAYA LAKES; SEED BANK; WETLAND
AB We conducted an assessment of seed banks in 8 playa lakes on the Southern High Plains of Texas. The seedling-emergence technique was used to determine species composition in 2 environmental moisture regimes (drawdown and submerged). The Gleasonian model of van der Valk was used to predict field vegetation from floristic composition of the seed bank in each playa lake. Based on life-history characteristics of species found in the seed-bank, we predicted the composition of playa vegetation during May, June, and August for 2 years under 3 moisture regimes (dry, moist, flooded). Twenty-six of the 39 species found in the seed-bank were annuals that were able to exploit the rapidly changing moisture regime of playas. Although, seedling densities differed among playas, the model adequately predicted the composition of vegetation in the playas. As environmental variability increased (more annual wet-dry fluctuations), the model became less reliable. To improve the model for playas, we suggest inclusion of frequency, depth, and longevity of flooding in the model.

AB We examined characteristics of the invertebrates consumed by mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and green-winged teals (Anas crecca) and responses of these invertebrates to manipulations of flooding date in Suisun Marsh, Solano County, CA. Numbers of Chironomus stigmaterus midge larvae (Chironomidae) and Eogammarus confervicolus amphipods (Gammaridae) in mallard esophageal samples were positively correlated with abundance of these invertebrates in wetlands. Mallards primarily consumed large midge larvae (fourth instars) and amphipods (>5 mm in length). Smaller green-winged teals consumed smaller midges. Mallards consumed few Trichocorixa verticalis water boatmen (Corixidae) or Cricotopus sylvestris midge larvae, despite their being abundant. Wetlands first flooded in early September had higher winter populations of amphipods and Berosus ingeminatus beetle larvae (Hydrophilidae) than wetlands first flooded in late October. Late-winter abundance of benthic C. stigmaterus midge larvae was highest at 40-cm water depths in the former habitats and at 20-cm depths in the latter habitats.

AB Over the past 30 years, various methods have been developed to identify and delineate wetlands for regulatory purposes in the United States. This paper discusses major limitations of existing methods and offers an alternative method called the ''primary indicators method.'' This new method is based on using features (national and regional plant and soil characteristics) unique to wetlands for identifying wetlands and their boundaries. These primary indicators permit accurate wetland determinations and delineations in the absence of significant hydrologic modification because these features only develop in wetlands. Wetlands subject to significant drainage require an assessment of the current hydrology.

DE WETLAND CLASSIFICATION; AERIAL VIDEOGRAPHY; UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER;
   REMOTE SENSING
AB We evaluated the use of aerial videography for classifying wetland habitats along the upper Mississippi River and found the prompt availability of habitat feature maps to be the major advantage of the video imagery technique. We successfully produced feature maps from digitized video images that generally agreed with the known distribution and areal coverages of the major habitat types independently identified and quantified with photointerpretation techniques. However, video images were not sufficiently detailed to allow us to consistently discriminate among the classes of aquatic macrophytes present or to quantify their areal coverage. Our inability to consistently distinguish among emergent, floating, and submergent macrophytes from the feature maps may have been related to the structural complexity of the site, to our limited vegetation sampling, and to limitations in video imagery. We expect that careful site selection (i.e., the desired level of resolution is available from video imagery) and additional vegetation samples (e.g., along a transect) will allow improved assignment of spectral values to specific plant types and enhance plant classification from feature maps produced from video imagery.

AB Northern pike (Esox lucius) were stocked in and sampled from two diked Lake Erie wetlands from 1985 to 1987 to determine if there was selection for common carp (Cyprinus carpio), a nuisance species, and what effect a closed, shallow water environment would have on survival, growth, and reproduction of northern pike. In both wetlands, feeding was selective for soft-rayed prey, mainly carp and goldfish (Carassius auratus). There was also positive selection for larger soft-rayed prey versus spiny-rayed prey. The survival rate (13 percent) for West Marsh was low, but growth was greater than reported in the literature, and stocked northern pike successfully reproduced. In Darr Marsh, survival was not measured, growth was high, and there was no evidence of reproduction when sampling ended in summer.

DE CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; BULLDOZED PONDS; WATERFOWL; MINNESOTA
AB Waterfowl pair and brood use of constructed wetlands was evaluated during 1980-81 on 4 Wildlife Management Areas in northwestern Minnesota. Weekly ground counts of waterfowl were made at each of 109 wetlands during the April to mid-July nesting season and correlated with physical, vegetative, and limnological characteristics. The number of pairs of the 10 most common waterfowl species using the wetlands was 338 in 1980 and 239 in 1981, of which blue-winged teal (Anas discors) made up nearly half. Ducks used the constructed wetlands primarily during late May and early June. Eighteen habitat components were significantly correlated with pair numbers of 1 or more duck species. Wetlands with larger surface area and longer shoreline length had greater pair use by every duck species except gadwall (Anas strepera). Other physical parameters correlated with duck use included distance to nearby large impoundments, wetland density, and distance to nearest constructed wetland.

AB The wetlands of the 20 coastal counties in North Carolina were digitized from National Wetland Inventory (NWI) maps to determine the diversity and extent of wetland habitat in coastal North Carolina. The counties were divided into three geographical areas to examine wetland patterns from the northern to the southern portion of coastal North Carolina. The wetland community types were digitized as palustrine forest, palustrine shrub, palustrine emergent, partly drained, estuarine emergent, estuarine shrub, and other. The wetlands for the 20 coastal counties totaled 957,470 ha. Palustrine forest wetlands were the predominant wetland type, comprising 64.8 percent of total wetland area. Ten percent were palustrine shrub wetlands, 11 percent partly drained, and 11 percent estuarine wetlands. Deciduous forest wetlands accounted for 47 percent of palustrine forest wetlands; 32 percent were evergreen forests. Evergreen shrub wetlands accounted for 62 percent of palustrine shrub wetlands. A shift of deciduous wetlands in the northern coastal counties to evergreen or mixed community wetlands in the southern coastal counties was observed. Wetland losses were estimated to be 44 percent of the original wetland area in the 20 coastal counties using hydric soils as an historical baseline.

DE AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY; FAUNAL HABITAT; WATER-LEVEL
   REGULATION; RESERVOIRS
AB Water-level regulation has altered the plant species composition and thus the structure of nearshore aquatic macrophyte communities in two regulated lakes in northern Minnesota as compared with a nearby unregulated lake. Results of previous faunal studies in the regulated lakes were used as a basis for assessing the effects of vegetation changes on faunal communities. The unregulated lake with mean annual water-level fluctuations of 1.6 m supported structurally diverse plant communities and varied faunal habitat at all depths studied. Mean annual fluctuations on one regulated lake were reduced to 1.1 m, and dense beds of four erect aquatic macrophytes dominated the 1.75-m depth that was never dewatered. We suggest that this lack of plant diversity and structural complexity resulted in diminished habitat for invertebrates, reduced availability of invertebrates as food for waterbirds and fish, reduced winter food supplies for muskrats, and reduced feeding efficiency for adult northern pike, yellow perch, and muskellunge. Mean annual fluctuations in the other regulated lake were increased to 2.7 m, and rosette and mat-forming species dominated the 1.25-m depth that was affected by winter drawdowns. We suggest that the lack of larger canopy plants resulted in poor habitat for invertebrates, reduced availability of invertebrates as food for waterbirds and fish, and poor nursery and adult feeding habitat for many species of fish. In addition, the timing and extent of winter drawdowns reduced access to macrophytes as food for muskrats and as spawning habitat for northern pike and yellow perch. In regulated lakes throughout the world, indirect effects on aquatic fauna resulting from alteration of wetland and aquatic macrophyte communities should be considered when water-level management plans are developed.

Irrigation resulted in taller and heavier swamp timothy (Heleochloa schoenoides), pricklegrass (Crypsis niliaca), and sprangletop (Leptochloa fasicularis). Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli) grew taller in irrigated wetlands, but no significant difference in weight was detected. Only sprangletop yielded larger seed masses in response to irrigation. Without irrigation, swamp timothy and pricklegrass assumed a typical prostrate growth form, but with irrigation, they assumed a vertical growth form. Irrigation did not significantly affect plant density. Because of rising water costs, wetland managers should consider wildlife management objectives and plant responses before implementing irrigation practices.

   WETLANDS; MEAN WATER-TABLE DEPTH; SEA-LEVEL RISE
AB The relationship between ground-water fluctuations and the canopy compositions of five tidal freshwater swamps were examined. Tide gauge data were compared with measured ground-water fluctuations to assess the role of tides in driving the hydrologic regimes of tidal swamps. Flooding in tidal swamps was found to be closely associated with high tides. As the tides dropped through the hummock zone (elevated area, about 15 cm high, to which the trees are restricted), drainage of the hollows (low areas between hummocks) occurred at the same rate as the falling tides. After the tides dropped below the elevation of the hollows, the lowering of the water table became much slower than that of the falling tides, presumably because peat in the root zone inhibited drainage. When the subsequent rising tides reached the elevation of the water table, the water table rose vertically with the tides. Flooding recurred in the hollows as the tides rose above the surface of the ground. The composition of the canopy was found to be related to the mean water-table depth (WTD) (i.e., the depth in relation to the hummock elevation at which the soil was flooded 50% of the time) and not to the duration, depth, or frequency of flooding. Tidal swamps dominated by Fraxinus spp. and Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora occurred in the wetter sites (mean WTD = 17 cm), whereas swamps dominated by Acer rubrum and Liquidambar styraciflua occurred in less wet sites (mean WTD = 21 to 30 cm). Tidal freshwater swamps are precariously positioned at the upper portion of the tidal range where they seem to keep pace with a rising sea level by accumulating biomass (logs and roots). Potential threats to the distribution and areal extent of tidal freshwater swamps include any abrupt changes in the rate of sea-level rise, periodic logging, or blockage of their upriver migration due to incompatible land use.

AB Vallentinia gabriellae (Hydrozoa) was collected from shallow water in a mangrove wetland along the eastern shore of the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Adult (gravid) medusae were collected in September 1990 and October 1990, non-gravid medusa in May 1991, and juvenile and gravid medusae in July 1991. All were observed or collected in the perimeter ditch of a mosquito impoundment (Impoundment 19A) in St. Lucie County, Florida. This impoundment has culverts installed along the perimeter dike that connect impoundment waters with those of the Indian River Lagoon. No specimens were found in other adjoining wetland impoundments or in adjacent lagoon waters. No polyps were found despite intensive field collection efforts. To our knowledge, this represents the first record of V. gabriellae from the Indian River Lagoon.
   Laboratory feeding studies indicate that V gabriellae can feed on a variety of zooplankters commonly found in impoundment waters. These data suggest that, when present, this predatory hydrozoan may be an important predator of zooplankton in mangrove wetland food chains. Preliminary data on food selection show some size selectivity in the feeding process.

DE SALINITY; WETLANDS; BALDCYPRESS; LOBLOLLY PINE; HURRICANE
AB Six-month-old and eighteen-month-old baldcypress and loblolly pine seedlings were subjected to a simulated saltwater surge (salinity = 30 parts per thousand) for 0 to 5 days followed by flushing and daily watering with fresh water. Growth, biomass, and survival were monitored for 9 weeks following inundation. Six-month-old seedlings of both species were extremely susceptible to saltwater flooding, and survival percentages declined rapidly beyond 1 day of saltwater flooding. Eighteen-month-old seedlings were better able to survive saltwater flooding, with some pine seedlings surviving up to 3 days of flooding and some baldcypress up to 4 days of flooding. The general response of surviving baldcypress seedlings to saltwater flooding was to die back and then resprout. For loblolly pine, growth was slowed until a threshold level was reached, at which point the seedlings died. There was a direct correlation between duration of saltwater flooding and diameter growth with six-month-old seedlings but not with the eighteen-month-old seedlings. There was a steady decline in diameter with increasing days of saltwater flooding in surviving eighteen-month-old baldcypress, whereas eighteen-month-old loblolly seedlings showed some diameter growth even after 3 days of saltwater flooding. Root:shoot biomass partitioning in surviving seedlings was not appreciably affected by treatments.

AB This study examines the magnitude and causes of wetland alterations within the North Carolina coastal plain. Utilizing soil maps, photointerpretation, and National Wetland Inventory Maps, we assessed wetland alterations between presettlement, the early 1950s, and the early 1980s on 27 randomly selected sample sites. Wetland alterations were defined and assessed in terms of the support of wetland function and values (i.e., uses). The study found that 51.3% of the historic wetlands in the sample had been altered by the early 1980s such that they no longer fully supported their original wetland functions and values. Between the early 1950s and the early 1980s, approximately 15.9% of the historic wetlands were altered such that original functions and values were not fully supported. The percentage of alteration differed greatly between estuarine and palustrine wetlands. Palustrine wetlands experienced a mean percent alteration of 52.4% by the early 1980s, while only 12.2% of the estuarine wetlands were altered. Between the early 1950s and the early 1980s, 16.9% of the historic palustrine wetlands were altered, as compared to only 9.9% of the estuarine wetlands. The conversion of wetlands for forestry caused 52.8% of the total alteration, followed by agriculture, which caused 42.2% of the total loss of wetlands. Urbanization, road construction, and rural residential development accounted for only a small percentage of the total loss of wetlands. The State of North Carolina needs to reevaluate the effectiveness of its wetland protection strategies (both administrative and legislative) to control future alterations of palustrine wetlands. Further work is also needed to determine recent trends in wetland alterations between the early 1980s to the 1990s, which may reflect more recent federal and state regulatory actions. Finally, similar survey work needs to be completed for the entire state to more fully understand wetland alteration trends in North Carolina.

   REGIME; WETLAND CREATION
AB Sediment was transplanted from a 13-yr-old created wetland on a nonacid mine in east Texas into a constructed experimental basin to examine seed bank response to 4 drawdown regimes. The experimental basin was flooded following sediment transplantation in February, and surface water was later removed in April, June, and August. The success of the transplanted seed bank in vegetating the experimental wetland was assessed by measuring species richness, seedling density, and above-ground biomass. April drawdown produced the greatest species richness (29), stem density (1851.0 stems m-2), and above-ground biomass (769.3 g m-2), followed by the unflooded water regime. June and August drawdowns produced less emergent vegetation than the other treatments, but 3 submergent species were produced prior to drawdowns. Results indicate that use of transplanted species-rich wetland soil subjected to early spring drawdown is a very effective technique for establishing wetland vegetation on disturbed sites in east Texas. In addition, re-establishment of vegetation in the donor wetland was assessed by comparing percent cover in disturbed plots to undisturbed plots. Disturbed plots achieved 66.0 percent cover after 10 months following soil removal compared to 96.3 percent cover in undisturbed plots. Disturbed plots were dominated by vegetatively reproducing species and contained very few annuals. Excavating relatively few widely-spaced narrow strips of soil from the donor wetland caused only slight decreases in vegetative cover during the subsequent growing season.

DE INTERMITTENT WETLANDS; GROUND WATER; SOIL WATER; WELL HYDROGRAPHS;
   EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; NORTH-DAKOTA
AB The water table in many intermittent wetland areas can rise greatly with a small amount of infiltration. Three intermittent wetland areas in eastern North Dakota show how hydrological conditions relate to changes of the water table. Two processes, air entrapment beneath an inverted water table and infiltration into the capillary fringe can cause the water table to rise more than ten times the amount of infiltration. Although run-off may provide the primary contribution to surface water volume in some intermittent wetlands, surface water may also accumulate during minor precipitation in wetlands where the capillary fringe is near or intersects the ground surface. Air-filled pores only constitute a small fraction of total porosity in most wet, fine-grained soils of intermittent wetlands. With a small amount of infiltration, surface water may accumulate when the thick fringe of tension saturation above the water table is changed to pressure saturation. Small values of air-filled porosity also influence the estimate of actual evapotranspiration made from shallow well hydrographs. The use of specific yield in formulas leads to an excessively large rate of actual evapotranspiration, but estimates can be improved by using a ratio of water-level rise to infiltration for the storage factor. Established methods of analysis are also improved by using both the recession and recovery slope of the diurnal cycle shown on the hydrograph.

AB The objective of this study was to compare hydric soils, wetlands, and land-use patterns for two counties in coastal North Carolina with a Geographic Information System. Soils were digitized from Soil Conservation Service county soil surveys, wetlands from National Wetland Inventory (NWI) maps, and land-use patterns from an environmental atlas of the coastal zone of North Carolina. The soils were consolidated into hydric mineral, hydric organic, and nonhydric soils for analysis. The areas of hydric soils were compared with wetlands or with land use to provide information on the relative distribution of wetland communities by soil type and conversions of wetlands into non-wetland areas by land use. Approximately 50 percent (87,650 ha) of the pre-settlement wetlands have been drained and converted to other uses. The conversions were more pronounced on hydric mineral soils. Conversions of wetlands for agricultural purposes accounted for 63 percent of wetland losses while conversions to pine plantations accounted for an additional 17 percent. Fifteen percent of the existing wetlands were in a state of transition to other land uses. This landscape-level approach complements detailed field studies that examine soil and plant relationships at individual field sites.

AB Responses of macroinvertebrate populations to temporal change and to management of plant cover and water depth were examined in 12 experimental ponds designed to mimic seasonally flooded (early autumn to early spring) wetlands in Suisun Marsh, California. Ponds were flooded in September 1988. Initially, rat-tailed maggots (Eristalis tenax), brine fly larvae (Ephydra millbrae), and mosquito larvae (Culex tarsalis) were numerically dominant components of the fauna in the ponds, but these populations did not persist beyond December. Water boatmen (Trichocorixa verticalis), midge larvae (Cricotopus sylvestris and Chironomus stigmaterus), and hydrophilid beetle larvae (Berosus ingeminatus) were numerically dominant components of the fauna in both autumn and winter, but water boatmen and midge densities declined by March. Amphipods (Eogammarus confervicolus) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were introduced during initial floodings in September, and they subsequently increased to become numerically dominant components of the pond fauna by February and March 1989. Higher numbers of adult water boatmen and hydrophilid beetles colonized habitats that had 50% of the plant cover removed by mowing than habitats that had not been mowed (100% plant cover). Since mowing also reduced numbers of mosquito larvae, this approach may benefit waterfowl management and reduce public health concerns.

AB Information was compiled on permits issued under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for alteration of freshwater wetlands from January 1982-August 1987 in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. The location, area, wetland type, and other data describing the impacted and compensatory (i.e., created, restored, and preserved) wetlands were compiled and analyzed. Trends in Louisiana, the state with the most permits issued, were emphasized, and a synopsis of the results from Alabama and Mississippi is presented for comparison. The objective of the study was to uncover patterns and trends in Section 404 permitting in the three states to document the effects of the permit decisions. Only the information contained in the permit record was compiled and analyzed. No judgment was made concerning compliance with the terms of the permits or whether the compensatory wetland replaced the ecological functions of the wetland destroyed. Neither could be determined from the permit record. In Louisiana, 226 permits were issued, resulting in a potential loss of over 10,000 hectares of primarily forested wetlands. Compensatory mitigation was required in 93 permits (41%); however, only 8% of the total area impacted by all permits issued was compensated. Over 50% of the wetlands impacted were less than or equal to 4 hectares in size. Permitted activities occurred throughout Louisiana, but the majority were located along the Gulf coast and the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. Food chain support and wildlife habitat were the most commonly listed impacted functions in the permit record. Specific objectives for the mitigation projects were not documented. Only 10% of the compensatory wetlands were monitored by at least one site visit. The Section 404 permitting program could be evaluated more effectively if record-keeping was standardized. The accuracy and thoroughness of this report was affected by poor record-keeping and inconcise permit language. Requirements for follow-up monitoring and increasing the specificity of the information contained in the permits would provide information on the impacts to wetlands and their functions to be considered in future permit decisions.

AB After the removal of domestic cattle and water buffalo in 1982, the monsoonal wetlands of the Keoladeo National Park, India were rapidly overgrown by the grass Paspalum distichum L. We studied the decomposition of above-ground litter of Paspalum distichum and that of ten submersed, floating-leaved, free-floating and emergent species, including the dominants in these wetlands prior to 1982. The only species that had decomposition rates as low as those of Paspalum were the emergents, Pseudoraphis spinescens (R. Br.) Vickery and Typha angustata Bory & Chaub, which had very restricted distributions both before and after 1982. All the previous dominants had much higher decomposition rates. The turnover time for Paspalum litter was estimated to be greater than one year, while litter of the previous dominants all had turnover times of less than one year. Thus, a permanent litter layer could develop in these wetlands that had not been present previously.

AB The emergent vegetation-open water interface plays an important role in the use of freshwater wetlands by many species of animals. The objective of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of free-swimming invertebrates at the cattail (Typha x glauca Godr.)-open water interface in two bays (sheltered and unsheltered) in the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba during 19 8 5. Submersed vegetation densities were higher in the open water sites of the sheltered bay during most of the summer. Water temperatures were constant across the interface through much of the year. By mid-summer, hypoxic conditions prevailed within the water column in the cattail stand. Algae levels were similar across the interface throughout much of the year, with peaks occurring just inside the interface in June and July. Early in the season, there was a trend for higher nektonic invertebrate numbers within the cattail stands of both bays. By late August, there were similar total invertebrate numbers across the interface. Cladocera and ostracod numbers were higher within the cattail stands during June and July; during the same periods, corixid levels were higher in the open water sites. The low oxygen levels within the cattail stands during the summer may reduce predation by fish and other predators that cannot tolerate low oxygen levels. This may explain the higher numbers of prey species like cladocerans and ostracods within the cattail stands during mid-summer. The presence of algal or detrital food resources seemed to have little influence on invertebrate abundance across the interface during this study. Peaks in invertebrate abundance did not occur at the emergent vegetation-open water interface during any of the sampling periods in this study. The high invertebrate diversity and abundance in interspersed wetland habitat may be related more to the mixture of habitat types rather than the amount of interface present.

ID LIME TREATMENT; CRAYFISH; SWEDEN
AB The fish fauna in 22 limed and seven unlimed small streams was monitored using yearly electrofishing to assess the effects of liming on species occurrence and abundance. The liming techniques were divided into three main methods, lake liming, doser liming and wetland liming, to evaluate whether different strategies had different effects on the fish fauna. The predominant species at the investigated stations were salmonids, mainly brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Other species generally occurred in low numbers. The average number of fish species did not increase significantly after liming, which was probably due to recolonization difficulties caused by the frequent occurrence of migration obstacles in the streams. After liming the density of salmonids increased significantly, irrespective of the liming method. Other fish species showed no general increase, but in individual streams significant increases of European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and bullhead (Cottus gobio) occurred. Some unlimed streams had acid spates with a pH below 6, which immediately lowered the numbers of salmonid parr. Other unlimed streams lost fish species progressively due to increasing acidification. pH, and probably increased levels of metals, were the major factors regulating the fish fauna. Few examples of biotic interactions were observed. but with an increase of Atlantic salmon parr after liming, brown trout abundances decreased in three streams.

AB As a consequence of decreases in the emission rate of sulphur in eastern North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s, sulphate deposition in central Ontario declined by about 40%, but has remained constant for about six years. Plastic Lake, a small, dilute lake on the Precambrian shield that the authors have studied since 1979, acidified between the start of the study and about 1986, but since then has not changed. The authors also monitored the chemistry of streamwater draining the Plastic Lake catchment.
   Water quality of runoff from an upland site improved rapidly (pH and alkalinity increased, SO42- and Al decreased), but two factors offset these improvements. A small wetland area downstream reversed most of these changes, resulting in a constant output of strong acid from the catchment. In addition, in extremely dry years (1983, 1987, 1989) there were very high concentrations of SO42- in the streamwater, suggesting substantial re-oxidation of reduced S in the catchment.

DE WETLAND CREATION; RESTORATION; HABITAT DEVELOPMENT; WATERBIRDS;
   WATERFOWL HABITAT; IMPOUNDMENTS
AB A waterfowl habitat development project along 7.5 miles (12.07 km) of stream was evaluated after 27 years.  There was a modest 12% net increase in wetlands in impounded areas, but much of the wetland vegetation changed from seasonally flooded, nonpersistent and persistent emergents to shallow, open-water areas.  An unimpounded, downstream reference area had drier plant communities, probably resulting from reduced flooding.  The loss of shallow vegetated wetlands could have significant impacts on both water quality functions and waterbird populations.  The overall project goal of increasing numbers and diversity of waterfowl was met, but waterfowl numbers and species composition changed more because of transplanting and nest-box programs than habitat modifications.  Although impacts on birds of shallow wetlands such as rails and songbirds were not quantitatively assessed, it is likely that the numbers of such birds were reduced because their preferred habitats were reduced markedly.  Use of smaller, lateral impoundments and increased management for emergents would diversify waterbird populations and increase dabbling duck production.

DE NUTRIA; MYOCASTOR-COYPUS; MICROHISTOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES; FOOD HABITS;
   FORESTED WETLANDS
AB Nutria (Myocastor coypus) diets and food preferences in selected freshwater forested wetlands of Louisiana were determined by microhistological examination of fecal pellets and stomach contents.  Lemna minor and Spirodela polyrrhiza (duckweeds) dominated the diet (yearly mean 55.5%) during all seasons on 4 of 6 sites sampled.  Nutria also ate substantial amounts of Pontederiaceae (Eichhornia crassipes and Pontederia cordata) (9.9%), Alternanthera philoxeroides (8.3%), Poaceae (mostly Panicum gymnocarpon) (5.1%), and woody tissue (6.8%).  Nutria diets varied among seasons, with spring diets containing more Poaceae (P < 0.01) and less Pontederiaceae (P < 0.01) than during other seasons.  Nutria showed seasonal preference for L. minor and S. polyrrhiza (spring and summer), Poaceae (spring), A. philoxeroides (summer and winter), and Cyperaceae (summer and fall).  Since L. minor and S. polyrrhiza dominated nutria diets even when they had relative cover values as low as 16.8%, nutria habitat quality should improve if freshwater forested wetland understories are converted (through natural or anthropogenic forces) to communities dominated by these plant species.

DT Article
DE WETLANDS; HYDROLOGY; SEDIMENTATION; BURIAL; NUTRIENTS
AB Litter decomposition was studied for one year in three Louisiana forested wetland sites with different flooding regimes.  Decomposition was significantly higher in a crayfish pond where flooding was manipulated by pumping.  Only 20% of the original dry mass remained after 46 weeks versus over 40% in the natural and impounded wetland forests.  Nitrogen was immobilized in the natural and impounded areas but was mineralized during the spring and summer in the managed area.  Phosphorus was not immobilized in the natural and impounded areas like nitrogen but was mineralized much more slowly in these areas than it was in the managed area.  Because of the slower decomposition in the natural and impounded areas, falling leaf litter buries the old, partially decomposed material.  Thus, there tends to be a net accumulation of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus in stagnant, more flooded areas and mineralization and/or export from free-flowing areas.

SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Note
DE CENTRARCHID; GROWTH; SALINITY; TIDAL WETLANDS
AB Use of tidal-freshwater and oligohaline wetlands by centrarchid fishes along a coastal river-estuarine gradient is partially controlled by salinity.  I examined length-weight relationships between tidal-freshwater and oligohaline populations of Micropterus salmoides, M. punctulatus, Lepomis microlophus, L. punctatus and L. macrochirus, species that commonly use saline wetlands.  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) documented significantly heavier specimens of Micropterus salmoides and Lepomis microlophus in tidal-freshwater (P < 0.05) than oligohaline marshes, whereas specimens of L. punctatus showed no detectable differences (P > 0.05) in length-weight patterns.  Specimens of L. macrochirus and M. punctulatus were heavier at a given length in tidal-freshwater than oligohaline marshes, but direct comparisons were not possible because of violation of the parallel slope assumption of ANCOVA.  Data on some species examined contradict previous laboratory physiological data which suggested that salinity and its rate of change control use of saline habitats by centrarchids.  These data support the hypothesis that use of habitat is a multidimension function of abiotic and biotic factors and that laboratory physiological studies based on abiotic factors alone may not provide all the answers to questions centered around life-history consequences of using various habitats.

AB Changes in mass, N, and P for old and new litter of four emergent plant species (Scolochloa festucacea (Willd1.) Link, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steud., Typha x glauca Godr., and Scirpus lacustris L. spp. glaucus (Sm.) Hartm.) were studied under two water-level regimes in a 10-cell experimental marsh complex in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada.  In the normal regime, water levels were kept at the regulated water level for Lake Manitoba until the fall of 1981, while in the flooded or high-water regime, they were raised 1 m above the regulated level in the fall of 1980.  In the spring of 1980, old litter (i.e., litter from the previous growing season) was placed in all ten cells of the complex, and in the fall of 1980, new litter (i.e., litter from the 1980 growing season) was placed in the same 10 cells.  Litter of S. festucacea had the highest mean decomposition rate (k = 0.00171), followed by T. x glauca (0.0131), S. l. glaucus (0.00126), and P. australis (0.00050).  Mean decomposition rates were higher in the flooded treatment than in the normal treatment for P. australis and S. festucacea.  Within water-level treatments, mass loss depended on initial litter age.
   The amount of N and P lost or gained by the end of 1981 varied with species, litter age, and water-level treatment.  Scolochloa festucacea old and new litter had a lower percent N and P remaining in the flooded than in the normal water-level treatment.  The percent N and P remaining in old litter of P. australis and S. l. glaucus at the end of the study was higher than that in new litterregardless of water-level treatment.  For T. x glauca, however, new litter had a higher percent of N and P remaining than old litter at the end of the study in both water-level treatments.  Litter with lower initial N and P levels accumulated more N and P than did that with higher initial levels.

TI HYDROLOGY OF 2 FORESTED WETLANDS THAT RECEIVE PUMPED AGRICULTURAL
   DRAINAGE WATER IN EASTERN NORTH-CAROLINA
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
AB Wetlands have been recommended for buffering the impact of agricultural drainage water on tidal rivers and estuaries.  This two-year study documented the hydrology of two wetland buffer areas in eastern North Carolina that received pumped agricultural drainage water.  The hydrology of both sites was documented by monitoring rainfall and pumping rates and by monitoring water surface elevations over a network of stations on each wetland.  Water velocities and wetland roughness coefficients were determined by dye tracer studies on the wetlands.  The pumping rates of drainage water onto the wetlands were highly variable, depending on the amount and intensity of rainfall and on the antecedent soil-water conditions on the agricultural area.  The two study sites, Laurel Bay (LB) and Northwest Fork (NF), differed in that the wetland at LB was larger in area and received drainage water from a smaller agricultural area.  Water depth on the wetland at LB increased by as much as 210 mm in response to pumping compared to a 380 mm maximum increase in water depth at NF.  Measured velocities of the pumped water on the LB wetland ranged from 400 to 900 m/d compared to 1600 to 4600 m/d at NF.  Factors causing lower velocities on the LB wetland were lower ground slope from the pumps to the receiving stream, greater resistance to flow, lower pumping rates, and better distribution of the pumped water (facilitated by a canal that distributed pumped water laterally before entering the wetland).  Lower velocities will result in greater residence times and greater pollutant removal on the wetland.

AB The hydrologic relationships of 15 lowland hardwood wetland habitat types in the Mingo Swamp of southeastern Missouri were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering multivariate techniques.  Both the PCA and cluster analyses defined significant differences among wetland types.  In all PCAs, the percentage of total water coverage, percentage of water < 10 cm deep, and percentage of water > 30 cm deep had the highest loading in factor I and were most useful in separating wetland types.  Typically, open water habitats were classified at one extreme in the analyses and pin oak/hickory habitats at the opposite extreme.  Dead tree, open marsh, ditch, and river habitats were usually closely grouped; however, all green-tree reservoir habitats were hydrologically shifted toward deeper, more permanently flooded conditions, especially in fall and early winter.

AB Fires occur naturally in many wetlands and are widely used for marsh management.  We examined the responses to fire of Juncus roemerianus and Spartina bakeri marshes on Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  In each marsh, we determined vegetation cover before burning on 5 permanent 15 m transects in the greater than 0.5 m and less than 0.5 m layers and sampled biomass on 25 plots (0.25 m2).  One year after burning, we repeated the sampling.  Species composition one year after burning was similar to that before the fire in both Juncus and Spartina marshes.  Minor species tended to increase, but this was significant only in the less than 0.5 m layer.  In mixed stands, fire appeared to favor Spartina bakeri.  Total cover (sum of the cover values for each species) in both marshes reestablished by one year after burning.  Biomass did not recover as rapidly.  In the Juncus marsh one year after burning, live biomass was 47.2%, standing dead 18.7%, and total biomass 29.3% of that before burning.  In the Spartina marsh, biomass one year after burning was live 42.3%, standing dead 21.4%, and total 30.7% of that before burning.  Fire increased the ratio of live to dead biomass from 0.82 before burning to 1.85 one year after the fire in the Juncus marsh.  In the Spartina marsh, the ratio of live to dead biomass increased from 0.80 before burning to 1.59 one year after burning.

TI NUTRIENT AND SEDIMENT REMOVAL IN FORESTED WETLANDS RECEIVING PUMPED
   AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE WATER
SO WETLANDS
LA English
DT Article
AB The effectiveness of two forested wetland buffer areas at removing sediment and nutrients from pumped agricultural drainage water was evaluated in a two-year field study.  The movement of these potential pollutants during pumping events was determined by sampling water quality at 36 stations distributed over each wetland.  Automatic water sampling continued after pumping events to determine the nutrient and sediment removal rates in the water left standing on the wetlands.  The total volume of water pumped during small events was effectively stored on the wetland until displaced by subsequent pumping or removed by evapotranspiration.  Nutrient and sediment concentrations of this stored water, which had several days of residence time on the wetland, were near background levels before leaving the wetlands.  Nutrient concentrations leaving the wetlands during these small events ranged from 0.03 to 0.04 mg/L for total phosphorus (TP) and from 0.0 to 0.1 mg/L for nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N).  Pumped water completely traversed the wetland during the less-frequent, larger pumping events.  Nutrient and sediment concentrations at the wetland outlet were often higher than background concentrations, ranging from 0 to 70 percent of the inflow concentrations.  Nutrient concentrations leaving the wetlands during these larger events ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 mg/L for TP and from 0.0 to 4.7 mg/L for NO3-N.  Sediment, TP, and NO3-N were removed from drainage water standing on the wetland.  This nutrient and sediment removal was described using a first order decay model.  Deposition of sediment was observed only within 800 m of the pumps, and was not resuspended during subsequent large pumping events.

AB Preliminary observations indicated that the productivity of wetlands in the Interlake region of Manitoba, Canada is low, resulting in limited use by waterfowl and other wildlife species.  This study compared nutrient availability, algal biomass, and invertebrate abundance and biomass between two Interlake wetlands.  The Narcisse site was a typical Interlake wetland with no known source of external nutrient input.  The Cruise Marsh site was a wetland similar to the Narcisse site except for the operation of a cattle feedlot on its shore.  Total dissolved and suspended N and P levels were higher at the Cruise Marsh site throughout much of the year.  Phytoplankton and epiphytic periphyton biomass were also much higher at Cruise Marsh.  The water chemistry and biomass of these two algae groups found in the Narcisse site were similar to levels characteristic of oligotrophic lakes.  The algae at Narcisse also showed severe N and P deficiency throughout the year, while no similar deficiency was observed at Cruise Marsh.  Epipelon biomass in unvegetated Narcisse sites was higher than found in vegetated Narcisse sites or at Cruise Marsh.  Invertebrate abundance and biomass were lower at Narcisse.  Cruise Marsh invertebrate abundance and biomass approached levels found in the more eutrophic Delta Marsh.  The Narcisse wetlands do appear to be nutrient limited, which in turn affects the algae and higher order consumers like invertebrates.  These low invertebrate levels likely play a role in the low use by waterfowl and other marsh birds in these wetlands.

DE FISH LARVAE; WETLANDS; LARVAL DISTRIBUTION; HABITAT; GREAT LAKES
AB Influences of habitat and selected physical and chemical variables on distribution of fish larvae were evaluated during spring and summer, 1984-85 in a diked Lake Erie wetland by determining densities of larvae in three simulated vegetation types and open water.  Larval gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), crappie (Pomoxis spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), carp (Cyprinus carpio), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) were the most abundant taxa in samples, collectively comprising over 94% of the total catch during both 1984 and 1985.  Gizzard shad and crappie were collected most often from open water areas of the marsh during both years of sampling.  Cyprinids (carp and goldfish) and sunfish were collected primarily from artificially vegetated habitats, usually floating vegetation in 1984 and emergent vegetation in 1985.  Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and transparency, measured concurrently with sampling did not seem to directly influence larval distribution.  Higher abundance of some species of larvae in the artificial vegetation may reflect both the use of vegetation as spawning substrate and increased availability of food or shelter.  Additional data collected from nearby undiked wetlands would help determine the function of diked wetlands as spawning and nursery habitat in terms of their importance to Great Lakes fish populations.

DE COMMON CARP; FISH POPULATION INDEXING; WETLANDS; WATERFOWL REFUGE
   MANAGEMENT
AB We evaluated gill netting and trap netting as tools to index relative abundance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in two national wildlife refuges in North and South Dakota.  Trap net catch rates were low (1.4/net night) and required much effort to obtain reliable sample sizes.  Gill nets had mesh sizes of 51, 76, and 102 mm (bar measure).  Each gill net had only one mesh size and three nets were thus needed to sample the entire length range of adult common carp for one unit of effort (one complement).  The mesh sizes were suitable for capturing 30-cm and longer common carp and precluded the need for intermediate mesh sizes.  Catch rates (number of common carp caught per net complement night) from May samples consistently had lower coefficients of variation than samples in June, July, or August.  Based on the mean and variance from our sampling, 125-684 net complement nights would provide reliable catch-rate data at the 95% confidence level.  More realistically, 8-43 net complement nights would provide reliable estimates at the 80% confidence level.  Accordingly, we recommend that an optimum sampling schedule would involve sampling in May and that each gill net have all three mesh sizes within one net.

ID FOREST SOIL; PH
AB The effects of Sphagnum and urban runoff on the bioavailability of metals were tested by adding PbCl2 and ZnCl2 to laboratory microcosms constructed of peat substrate with or without live Sphagnum spp. and planted with Acer rubrum L. seedlings or Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. shoots.  We hypothesized that Sphagnum would increase bioavailability through its acidifying action, while urban runoff would decrease availability through increases in alkalinity.  Metals were more available to the test plants treated with acidic swampwater than with alkaline runoff.  Sphagnum moss caused increases in tissue concentrations in V. macrocarpon, but not in A. rubrum.  The latter species took up more metals when grown on substrate from sites receiving runoff, whereas the former took up more metals from substrate from undisturbed sites, despite the lower substrate metal concentrations.  Differences in uptake by the two species may reflect differences in their ability to root in the Sphagnum mat.  The results demonstrate that Sphagnum spp. exerts strong species-specific effects on the uptake of metals by vascular plants, and that plant species native to acidic wetlands vary widely in their response to metals in the substrate.

AB Plant-specific and metal-specific uptake of Al, Cd, Pb and Hg are reviewed, using examples from bryophytes, lichens, wetland plants, woody plants and crop plants.  Ranges of plant metal concentration, toxic thresholds and effects, and effects of metal on biomass are derived from the literature.  Relationships of metal in plants to metals in sediment, soil, water and air are discussed. Plant Al is negatively correlated with pH of water in lakes and with soil pH.  Cadmium in crop plants is negatively related to soil pH.  Lead in submergents is related negatively to sediment pH at 4.5 to 6.  Little information on plant Hg was available.  Factors affecting plant uptake include soil or sediment organic content, carbon exchange capacity, oxide and carbonate content, and Eh as well as total metal content.

   WETLANDS
AB Preservation of bottomland hardwood forest wetlands is threatened by pressure from surface coal mining activities in the western Kentucky coalfield.  The contingent valuation survey method was used to measure the economic benefits (willingness-to-pay) of preserving the Clear Creek wetland, the largest wetland area in the coalfield, from surface coal mining.  Results indicated that Kentucky households are willing to pay between $6 and $13, in the form of voluntary contributions to a hypothetical "Wetland Preservation Fund," for preservation.  Mine reclamation as a substitute for preservation, recreational use of wetlands by survey respondents, conservation club membership, and age are determinants of willingness-to-pay.  Annual aggregate benefits of Clear Creek wetland preservation are estimated to be between $2.94 million and $19 million depending on aggregation assumptions.

AB Monthly surveys were conducted on Kennedy Space Center for one year to determine densities of waterbirds within impounded salt marshes that were predominantly open water with little emergent vegetation.  The objective was to assess the importance of these impoundments to waterbirds, particularly wading birds, which are species of special conservation concern.  Water-level management for mosquito control and waterfowl provided habitat for an abundance of ducks, shorebirds, coots, and wading birds.  Average densities throughout the year for these groups were 5.26, 4.12, 2.80, and 2.20 birds/ha, respectively.  The majority of waterfowl were present during the winter.  Shorebirds were most common during spring migration.  Wading bird densities increased with declining water level.  Due to the extensive alteration and development of coastal wetlands in central Florida, properly managed impoundments may provide important feeding areas for maintaining certain waterbird populations.
